Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate and celebrate \nthe life of an extraordinary and influential figure from Chicago's \nSouth Side, Bishop Charles Edward Davis. A native of Leland, \nMississippi, Bishop Davis's life was guided by service to his country, \nhis community, and his faith. After graduating high school in 1940, \nBishop Davis relocated to Chicago's Bronzeville neighborhood, at the \nbeginning of the Second Great Migration and the year before the United \nStates entered World War II. Heeding the call to serve his country \nafter the outbreak of war, Bishop Davis joined the U.S. Army at the age \nof 19, serving as a sergeant. In the Army, Bishop Davis would complete \ntours of duty in Germany, France, and Holland.\n  After the war, Bishop Davis would enter the upholstery business with \nhis dear friend Brother James McDonald, a step which would lead him \ntowards his lifetime of faith and good works. Brother McDonald's \nmother-in-law, Sister Anastasia Anderson, introduced him to the Indiana \nAvenue Pentecostal Church of God (IPC), and he became a member of the \nchurch in 1954 when it was under the pastorate of Elder Charles Ellis.\n  Recognizing the deep faith, commitment, and talent of Bishop Davis, \nElder Ellis's successor, Elder Odee Akines, encouraged the further \ndevelopment of his faith and leadership. With Elder Akines at the helm \nof IPC, Bishop Davis served as the church's Sunday School \nsuperintendent, Young People's Leader, and President of the senior \nchoir. By his side throughout his energetic leadership of the church \nwas Dr. Geraldine Olivia Davis, his dear wife of 43 years until her \npassing in 1998. Bishop Davis was also a devoted father to a son, \nLarney Bush, Jr., and a daughter, Yolanda Davis.\n  After Elder Akines passed away in 1970, Bishop Davis was elected \npastor of IPC. Himself a Doctor of Divinity and Master of Theology, \nBishop Davis made this a central focus during his leadership of IPC, \nestablishing scholarships and programs for young people seeking to \nfurther their educations in both the secular and Christian traditions. \nIn 1986, Bishop Davis was elevated to the Bishopric by the Pentecostal \nAssemblies of the World, serving as a Diocesan Bishop in New York \nState, Washington State, and Wyoming, eventually accepting a role as \nDiocesan of the 6th Episcopal District of the Pentecostal Assemblies of \nthe World, their Illinois District Council, in 2008.\n  Bishop Davis would come to be widely recognized as one of the \nPentecostal Assemblies of the World's most exemplary leaders, admired \nboth in Chicago and nationally for his character and conviction. This \ncaused him to become fondly known as ``Chief.'' Bishop Davis was a \nmentor to many young people who came to his churches seeking salvation, \nand always conducted robust community outreach efforts, making sure \nthat his good works did not only benefit IPC, but the entire \nneighborhood and city. Bishop Davis's work was recognized by the City \nof Chicago in 1992, when the 3500-3600 block of South Indiana Avenue \nwas named in his honor.\n  In 2004, Bishop Davis became united in marriage with Dr. Jessie \nDavis, and they were inseparable from one another, always working \ntogether for the spiritual benefit of their community. They would \nremain by each other's sides until Dr. Davis's death in April of 2020.\n  Madam Speaker, on February 9th, Bishop Davis was called to heaven \nafter a lifetime of good works. My deepest prayers and sympathies go \nout to Bishop Davis's family, friends, and the IPC community on the \npassing of this supremely devoted and talented leader, who gave so much \nin service to his faith, community, and country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "CELEBRATING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF BISHOP CHARLES E.

If you were to ask any of her patients--or the \nparents of some of her littler patients--they would without doubt echo \nthat her kindness, devotion, and concern for their health and wellbeing \nis at the core of everything she does.\n  PHC offers high-quality, affordable care to underserved and \nvulnerable populations in Des Moines, Ames, and Marshalltown. As Chief \nMedical Officer, Dr. Shreck helps ensure these patients receive \ncomprehensive health services, including medical and dental care, \nbehavioral health care, homeless support, and pharmacy services. In \n2019, PHC provided care for more than 38,000 Iowans.\n  Dr. Shreck has been instrumental in advancing the care-driven mission \nof community health centers in Iowa. When we began to see cases of \nCOVID-19 in our state, Dr. Shreck led PHC' s early response efforts and \ncoordinated with other healthcare organizations to establish a \ncommunity-wide strategy. She has continued to lead our medical, dental, \nand behavioral health staff through the challenging circumstances of \nthe past nine months.\n  PHC's staff--including Dr. Shreck--has gone above and beyond to make \nsure patients and clients received continuing health care from the \nonset of this pandemic. Their accomplishments are truly too many to \nlist, so I'd like to highlight a few.\n  With Dr. Shreck's leadership, PHC medical staff rapidly adapted to \nproviding care in new ways. For example, behavioral health providers \nworked alongside primary care teams to set up telehealth systems to \nmeet increasing demand for mental health care among kids and adults \nduring this pandemic. In the early days of the pandemic when most \ndental offices had to shutter, dedicated dental teams juggled work \nadjustments, staffing challenges, and new requirements for PPE in order \nto provide emergency care--which kept patients healthy while ensuring \nemergency room space remained available to treat those with COVID-19.\n  I cannot thank Dr. Shreck enough for her hard work and resolve in the \nface of this threat to the health of communities across Iowa. Despite \nthe long hours, stress, and concern for their own families, friends, \nand neighbors, Dr. Shreck and her team keep showing up to provide \nexceptional care.

I thank her once again for her achievements, and it is my distinct honor to name her this week's Iowan of the Week.\n\n                          ____________________", "speakers": ["Cynthia Axne"], "citation": "167 Cong.

Madam Speaker, I rise to note the upcoming celebration \nof St. David's Day on March 1. The feast day of St. David, the patron \nsaint of Wales, offers the opportunity to honor Welsh culture and \nheritage and note the links between Wales and the United States.\n  The Welsh were among the early settlers who emigrated from the \nBritish Isles to North America, and they came with the same motivations \nthat brought many generations from all over the world to our shores, \nincluding the pursuit of religious liberty and the opportunity to \ncreate a better life for themselves and their descendants. The man \nremembered as the first Welsh settler, Howell Powell, arrived in \nVirginia from Brecon in 1642. After William Penn founded Pennsylvania \nin 1681, having considered naming it New Wales, a large group of Welsh \nQuakers settled in the colony.\n  A century later, the Industrial Revolution brought a renewed wave of \nWelsh settlement to the United States. Immigrants from Wales farmed \nland, mined coal, made steel, and worked in a variety of other \nindustries that powered U.S. economic ascendancy.\n  We see the contributions of Wales to American history and culture in \nother ways, too. At least five signers of the Declaration of \nIndependence had a Welsh background, including its primary author \nThomas Jefferson. At least eight of our presidents have similarly come \nfrom Welsh descent.\n  The ties between Wales and the United States are not merely historic \nbut remain vibrant today. Welsh companies conduct business in the \nUnited States and keep Americans on their payrolls. As of 2019, the \nUnited States was the largest export market for Wales outside Europe.\n  In the House of Representatives, I serve as Chairman of the \nCongressional Friends of Wales Caucus, devoted to celebrating and \nstrengthening the ties between our two nations. Each year I look \nforward to our St. David's Day reception on Capitol Hill, attended by \nmembers of the Welsh community in the United States, leading officials \nin the Welsh government, and Members of Congress. Unfortunately, the \nreception will not go on as usual this year, but I will nevertheless be \nwearing a daffodil on March 1 to mark the holiday.\n  The last words of St. David were said to be, ``Be joyful, keep the \nfaith, and do the little things that you have heard and seen me do.'' \nPeople of Welsh heritage have come to embody this message in their \ncontributions to the United States and have not done only little things \nbut great things as well. On this St. David's Day, as one of the \nmillions of Americans with Welsh ancestry, I take pride in the \naccomplishments produced by the partnership between Wales and the \nUnited States and look forward to those to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "ST.

At least eight of our presidents have similarly come from Welsh descent.\n\tThe ties between Wales and the United States are not merely historic but remain vibrant today. Welsh companies conduct business in the United States and keep Americans on their payrolls. As of 2019, the United States was the largest export market for Wales outside Europe.\n\tIn the House of Representatives, I serve as Chairman of the Congressional Friends of Wales Caucus, devoted to celebrating and strengthening the ties between our two nations. Each year I look forward to our St. David's Day reception on Capitol Hill, attended by members of the Welsh community in the United States, leading officials in the Welsh government, and Members of Congress. Unfortunately, the reception will not go on as usual this year, but I will nevertheless be wearing a daffodil on March 1 to mark the holiday.\n\tThe last words of St. David were said to be, ``Be joyful, keep the faith, and do the little things that you have heard and seen me do.'' People of Welsh heritage have come to embody this message in their contributions to the United States and have not done only little things but great things as well. On this St. David's Day, as one of the millions of Americans with Welsh ancestry, I take pride in the accomplishments produced by the partnership between Wales and the United States and look forward to those to come.\n\n                          ____________________", "speakers": ["H.

Madam Speaker, it is with a heavy heart and solemn \nremembrance that I rise to pay tribute to a great man and my longtime \nfriend, Capt. (Ret) James Michael Kuzma. Jim passed away unexpectedly \non Friday, February 5, 2021, just three days shy of his 60th birthday.\n  Jim was born February 8, 1961 in Steubenville, Ohio. He earned a \nBachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from the U.S. \nNaval Academy, a Master of Science in Engineering Management from the \nCatholic University of America, and a Master of Science in National \nResource Strategy from the Industrial College of the Armed Forces \n(ICAF).\n  Jim served 28 years with the U.S. Navy before ``retiring'' to Cocoa \nBeach in 2011. I say ``retiring'' in quotations because anyone who knew \nJim knew that it was nearly unthinkable for him to rest. He was always \nthinking of creative ways to solve challenges. For the last decade, Jim \nserved as Space Florida's Senior Vice President and General Manager of \nthe Cape Canaveral Spaceport, working to cement the state's position as \na world leader in aerospace.\n  Recruited to Space Florida to strengthen and grow its operational \nsupport for the commercial space industry at Cape Canaveral Spaceport, \nJim embraced the mission and excelled at finding ways to respond to \nindustry's needs. He led efforts to secure Federal Aviation \nAdministration spaceport operating licenses for both the former Shuttle \nLanding Facility (SLF) and other former Government sites on Cape \nCanaveral Air Force Station. Jim spearheaded the transfer of the SLF to \nSpace Florida's management and operation, and he was instrumental in \nattracting Blue Origin to base its orbital program in Florida. For the \npast two years, he worked tirelessly to ensure a solution for replacing \nNASA's 1964 Indian River Bridge that would meet the spaceport's needs \nfar into the future. These were only a few examples Jim's \naccomplishments to further America's space program in positive ways.\n  Jim visited my office frequently in Washington, advocating for the \ncommercial space industry, offering creative solutions to problems, and \nurging needed regulatory reform to ensure America's leadership in \nspace. He served on the Board of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, \nand more recently on the CSF Executive Committee.\n  Jim began his Naval service on the USS Jacksonville SSN 699. He went \non to Naval Sea Systems Command, serving during 1988 through 90 as a \nFleet Liaison and Systems Test Director for various submarine Combat \nand Weapons System Program Offices. He served as Engineering Officer on \nthe USS Newport News SSN 750 from 1991 to 1994. In 1994, he was \nassigned to the Commander in Chief, U.S. Atlantic Fleet (CINCLANTFLT) \nNuclear Propulsion Examining Board. He served as the Executive Officer \non USS Atlanta SSN 712 from October 1996 to July 1998 before reporting \nto Submarine Warfare Division of the Office of the Chief of Naval \nOperations (OPNAV) staffer where he served as Submarine Combat Systems \nRequirements Officer. Following that, he served as the Commanding \nOfficer of the USS Boise 764 from March 2001 until October 2003. He \nthen became Deputy Director for Operations on the staff of the \nCommander, Naval Submarine Forces from 2003 to 2005. From October 2005 \nto August 2007, Captain Kuzma served as Special Activities Division \nChief on Strategic Command's Joint Functional Component Command for \nIntelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance staff before attending \nthe Industrial College of the Armed Forces (ICAF) from August 2007 to \nJune 2008. He rounded off his impressive Naval career as the Commanding \nOfficer of the Naval Ordnance Test Unit in Cape Canaveral (2008-2011).\n  Captain Kuzma's personal decorations include the Legion of Merit, \nBronze Star, Defense Meritorious Service Medal, two Meritorious Service \nMedals, six Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medals and four Navy and \nMarine Corps Achievement Medals. Yet, he never spoke about them. Jim \nwas indeed\n\n[[Page E165]]\n\npassionate about his work, but his greatest joy in life was his family. \nAnyone who spent time around Jim instantly knew that he was a family \nman; he delighted in attending concerts and visiting theme parks with \nhis family, especially his grandchildren. He is survived by Karen, his \nwife of 36 years, their four children, James Michael II (Andrea Pinzon-\nGarcia), William Jordan (Patricia Kuzma), Lauren Rose (Aaron Possinger) \nand Candace Marie and five grandchildren, Ariana, Lillian, Camilo, \nAdelaide, and Maverick. He is also survived by his mother, Catherine \nKuzma, and mother-in-law, Candace Jordan. He is also survived by \ninnumerable friends and colleagues, who all miss him dearly.\n  On a personal note, I am proud to have called Jim my friend for many \nyears. Jim served on my selection board for the U.S. Naval Academy. He \nbelieved in the importance of serving our nation and was a strong \nsupporter of our brave men and women in military uniform as well as our \nmilitary veterans.

Madam Speaker, it is with a heavy heart and solemn remembrance that I rise to pay tribute to a great man and my longtime friend, Capt. (Ret) James Michael Kuzma. Jim passed away unexpectedly on Friday, February 5, 2021, just three days shy of his 60th birthday.\n\tJim was born February 8, 1961 in Steubenville, Ohio. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from the U.S. Naval Academy, a Master of Science in Engineering Management from the Catholic University of America, and a Master of Science in National Resource Strategy from the Industrial College of the Armed Forces (ICAF).\n\tJim served 28 years with the U.S. Navy before ``retiring'' to Cocoa Beach in 2011. I say ``retiring'' in quotations because anyone who knew Jim knew that it was nearly unthinkable for him to rest. He was always thinking of creative ways to solve challenges. For the last decade, Jim served as Space Florida's Senior Vice President and General Manager of the Cape Canaveral Spaceport, working to cement the state's position as a world leader in aerospace.\n\tRecruited to Space Florida to strengthen and grow its operational support for the commercial space industry at Cape Canaveral Spaceport, Jim embraced the mission and excelled at finding ways to respond to industry's needs. He led efforts to secure Federal Aviation Administration spaceport operating licenses for both the former Shuttle Landing Facility (SLF) and other former Government sites on Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Jim spearheaded the transfer of the SLF to Space Florida's management and operation, and he was instrumental in attracting Blue Origin to base its orbital program in Florida. For the past two years, he worked tirelessly to ensure a solution for replacing NASA's 1964 Indian River Bridge that would meet the spaceport's needs far into the future. These were only a few examples Jim's accomplishments to further America's space program in positive ways.\n\tJim visited my office frequently in Washington, advocating for the commercial space industry, offering creative solutions to problems, and urging needed regulatory reform to ensure America's leadership in space. He served on the Board of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, and more recently on the CSF Executive Committee.\n\tJim began his Naval service on the USS Jacksonville SSN 699. He went on to Naval Sea Systems Command, serving during 1988 through 90 as a Fleet Liaison and Systems Test Director for various submarine Combat and Weapons System Program Offices. He served as Engineering Officer on the USS Newport News SSN 750 from 1991 to 1994. In 1994, he was assigned to the Commander in Chief, U.S. Atlantic Fleet (CINCLANTFLT) Nuclear Propulsion Examining Board. He served as the Executive Officer on USS Atlanta SSN 712 from October 1996 to July 1998 before reporting to Submarine Warfare Division of the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) staffer where he served as Submarine Combat Systems Requirements Officer. Following that, he served as the Commanding Officer of the USS Boise 764 from March 2001 until October 2003. He then became Deputy Director for Operations on the staff of the Commander, Naval Submarine Forces from 2003 to 2005. From October 2005 to August 2007, Captain Kuzma served as Special Activities Division Chief on Strategic Command's Joint Functional Component Command for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance staff before attending the Industrial College of the Armed Forces (ICAF) from August 2007 to June 2008. He rounded off his impressive Naval career as the Commanding Officer of the Naval Ordnance Test Unit in Cape Canaveral (2008-2011).\n\tCaptain Kuzma's personal decorations include the Legion of Merit, Bronze Star, Defense Meritorious Service Medal, two Meritorious Service Medals, six Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medals and four Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals. Yet, he never spoke about them. Jim was indeed\n[[Page E165]]\npassionate about his work, but his greatest joy in life was his family. Anyone who spent time around Jim instantly knew that he was a family man; he delighted in attending concerts and visiting theme parks with his family, especially his grandchildren. He is survived by Karen, his wife of 36 years, their four children, James Michael II (Andrea Pinzon-Garcia), William Jordan (Patricia Kuzma), Lauren Rose (Aaron Possinger) and Candace Marie and five grandchildren, Ariana, Lillian, Camilo, Adelaide, and Maverick. He is also survived by his mother, Catherine Kuzma, and mother-in-law, Candace Jordan. He is also survived by innumerable friends and colleagues, who all miss him dearly.\n\tOn a personal note, I am proud to have called Jim my friend for many years. Jim served on my selection board for the U.S. Naval Academy. He believed in the importance of serving our nation and was a strong supporter of our brave men and women in military uniform as well as our military veterans. Jim was proud of our nation's space program, worked tirelessly to promote America's mission in Space along with our commercial space endeavors, and was champion for local businesses in Brevard County, Florida.\n\tMadam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in saluting Captain James Kuzma for a lifetime of service to the United States and his fellow citizens. I would also like to ask my colleagues in the House to join us in extending our deepest sympathies to Jim's family, friends, colleagues, and loved ones during this difficult time.\n\n                          ____________________", "speakers": ["Bill Posey"], "citation": "167 Cong.

His first assignment at LLNL was in the \nPhysics Directorate, where his portfolio included diverse national \nsecurity and science programs. This positioned him well to take on \nsupervisory and senior management roles, such as Associate Director of \nPhysical and Life Sciences, then Deputy Director for Science and \nTechnology, where he was tasked with leading the strategic deployment \nof LLNL's science and technology capabilities. He continued to impress \nand was named LLNL's 12th director and LLNS' 3rd president on March 31, \n2014.\n  Under Bill's leadership during the past seven years, LLNL's budget \nand workforce have grown by 50 percent and 25 percent respectively. In \nfact, in 2020, LLNL was listed in the top ten of GlassDoor's 100 best \nlarge places to work in the United States. All of this occurred despite \never-increasing competition for talent from nearby Silicon Valley.\n  LLNL has experienced significant growth in all programs and \noperations with Bill at the helm. He has prepared it and its personnel \nto lead a new era of nuclear stockpile stewardship, ensuring that our \nnuclear weapons are responsibly maintained and keeping the United \nStates at the forefront of innovation. Much of this is made possible by \nSierra, a new class of supercomputer brought into the field in the last \nfew years. Bill's holistic and multi-jurisdictional thinking continues \nto enable growth and flexibility throughout LLNL operations and our \nnational security.\n  Most recently, Bill not only helped his LLNL team navigate the new \nworkforce realities brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, but he and \nhis management team also did their part to make significant \ncontributions to the fight against the disease, fabricating emergency \nventilators, using 3D printing to fabricate nasal swabs, and providing \npredicted structures of a key COVID-19 viral protein to help accelerate \nthe development of potential medical treatments for the disease.\n  As if all that was not enough, Bill has authored or co-authored more \nthan 70 papers on a variety of topics while a fellow of the American \nPhysical Society and the American Association for the Advancement of \nScience.\n  I thank Bill for his nearly four decades of service.

It was sort of a national joke.\n  But what was happening in Texas was not a joke. These conditions were \nunprecedented. But they found Texas unable to really respond in a way \ndespite the fact that 10 years ago there was a similar situation. It is \nfascinating. Ted Cruz isn't the only one struggling with the truth. The \nGovernor of Texas, Governor Abbott, sought to blame wind energy for \ntheir plight. Wind energy, which supplies less than 10 percent of the \ntotal energy supply for the State, performed better than fossil fuel \nwhich provided the majority of it.\n  Think for a moment how they attempted to target the Green New Deal \nand AOC. While Ted Cruz was struggling to get his story straight, our \ncolleague, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, was raising millions of dollars to \nhelp people in Texas cope. Blaming a Green New Deal which has never \nactually been enacted--it is an aspirational goal--is foolish. What we \nhave seen in Texas with those extreme weather events are a preview of \ncoming attractions.\n  What we saw in Australia this last year and in the Western United \nStates with horrific wildfires, looking at a once-in-a-century weather \nevent is becoming routine, and it is going to happen more and more \nfrequently.\n  I would suggest that Texas leadership could take a look at what they \nhave done. Their famously deregulated energy system has given the \nfamily with a $16,000 electric bill or former Governor and Energy \nSecretary Rick Perry said: Well, people would just be happy to have a \nfew days without energy to be free of the dangers of Federal \nregulation.\n  I think people in the surrounding States that survived much better \nand didn't have $16,000 monthly electric bills might review that. I \nwould suggest that the folks in Texas leadership could start first of \nall by telling the truth. It is not renewable energy, it was fossil \nfuel that failed and continued reliance on fossil fuel is going to make \nevents like this much, much more frequent.\n  We need to deal with reliability in Texas and around the country. \nLast, but not least, we must fight for climate justice and a low carbon \nfuture.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. McGovern) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, over the past two decades, I have traveled \nto Colombia more than a dozen times. On each trip, I have had the \nprivilege of meeting human rights defenders and social leaders.\n  In cities, towns, and remote rural areas, these brave men, women, and \nyoung people have confronted violence all their lives, and they and \ntheir communities are targeted by illegal armed groups--paramilitaries, \nguerrillas, and criminal organizations. They have been targets of the \nColombian military and too often harassed and under illegal \nsurveillance by the state. Simply for speaking on behalf of others, \norganizing to meet basic needs, or carrying out the duties of their \nprofession--teacher, doctor, farmer, lawyer, journalist, and pastor--\nthey are threatened, assaulted, and murdered.\n  During my last trip to Colombia, I spent a few days in the mountains \nof northern Cauca. I met with indigenous leaders defending their right \nto ancestral lands. I met with Afro-Colombian leaders creating small \nenterprises to support their families and their children. I met with \ndemobilized FARC soldiers hoping to build a new life and future. I met \nwith campesino farmers determined to stop growing coca and move into \nthe legal economy.\n  We sat together, and we ate together. They shared their plans and \nthey shared their dreams with me. They dream of a Colombia at peace and \na Colombia that values all of its people, including those who have \nstruggled to survive in Colombia's most violent rural areas.\n  Brave, generous, intelligent, creative, vulnerable, and humble, these \nleaders literally have bet their lives on the peace accord being fully \nimplemented. They are counting on the peace accord to deliver the \nprotection, economic development, truth, and justice it promised.\n  But the Colombian state has abandoned them, just as it has throughout \nall Colombia's history. The state has failed to put in place the \nindividual and community-based protections demanded by the peace \naccord. The state has failed to dismantle the criminal networks and \narmed actors who daily threaten the lives of social leaders. The state \nhas failed to identify and prosecute those who finance, profit by, and \norder the murders and violence aimed at human rights defenders and \nsocial leaders. Even worse, the Colombian state has chosen to remain \nabsent from large parts of the country, failing to establish state \npresence, basic services, and leaving local leaders defenseless.\n  Since the peace accord was signed, over 500 rights defenders have \nbeen murdered, according to the United Nations human rights \nrepresentative. Colombia's own ombudsman reports even higher numbers, \ndocumenting more than 700 murders during that same period, and \nnongovernmental organizations place the total even higher.\n  Rather than seeing this grim reality as a call to action, the \ngovernment of President Ivan Duque has tried to obscure the number of \nmurder victims. His government defends all the promises it has made on \npaper without changing by one iota the reality on the ground. It acts \nas if these murders and threats were some kind of public relations \ncrisis, a battle over statistics and optics.\n  But it is not a PR problem. It is lives on the line. Economists have \nwritten books on the importance of human capital in the development of \na prosperous economy. Lack of political will to prevent these murders \nand protect these local leaders is literally bleeding Colombia of the \nvery human capital it needs to consolidate peace and create a more \nprosperous and dynamic future.\n\n  Two weeks ago, Human Rights Watch issued a report on the murders of \nColombia's social leaders and human rights defenders.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) for 5 minutes.\n\tMr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, over the past two decades, I have traveled to Colombia more than a dozen times. On each trip, I have had the privilege of meeting human rights defenders and social leaders.\n\tIn cities, towns, and remote rural areas, these brave men, women, and young people have confronted violence all their lives, and they and their communities are targeted by illegal armed groups--paramilitaries, guerrillas, and criminal organizations. They have been targets of the Colombian military and too often harassed and under illegal surveillance by the state. Simply for speaking on behalf of others, organizing to meet basic needs, or carrying out the duties of their profession--teacher, doctor, farmer, lawyer, journalist, and pastor--they are threatened, assaulted, and murdered.\n\tDuring my last trip to Colombia, I spent a few days in the mountains of northern Cauca. I met with indigenous leaders defending their right to ancestral lands. I met with Afro-Colombian leaders creating small enterprises to support their families and their children. I met with demobilized FARC soldiers hoping to build a new life and future. I met with campesino farmers determined to stop growing coca and move into the legal economy.\n\tWe sat together, and we ate together. They shared their plans and they shared their dreams with me. They dream of a Colombia at peace and a Colombia that values all of its people, including those who have struggled to survive in Colombia's most violent rural areas.\n\tBrave, generous, intelligent, creative, vulnerable, and humble, these leaders literally have bet their lives on the peace accord being fully implemented. They are counting on the peace accord to deliver the protection, economic development, truth, and justice it promised.\n\tBut the Colombian state has abandoned them, just as it has throughout all Colombia's history. The state has failed to put in place the individual and community-based protections demanded by the peace accord. The state has failed to dismantle the criminal networks and armed actors who daily threaten the lives of social leaders. The state has failed to identify and prosecute those who finance, profit by, and order the murders and violence aimed at human rights defenders and social leaders. Even worse, the Colombian state has chosen to remain absent from large parts of the country, failing to establish state presence, basic services, and leaving local leaders defenseless.\n\tSince the peace accord was signed, over 500 rights defenders have been murdered, according to the United Nations human rights representative. Colombia's own ombudsman reports even higher numbers, documenting more than 700 murders during that same period, and nongovernmental organizations place the total even higher.\n\tRather than seeing this grim reality as a call to action, the government of President Ivan Duque has tried to obscure the number of murder victims. His government defends all the promises it has made on paper without changing by one iota the reality on the ground. It acts as if these murders and threats were some kind of public relations crisis, a battle over statistics and optics.\n\tBut it is not a PR problem. It is lives on the line. Economists have written books on the importance of human capital in the development of a prosperous economy. Lack of political will to prevent these murders and protect these local leaders is literally bleeding Colombia of the very human capital it needs to consolidate peace and create a more prosperous and dynamic future.\n\n\tTwo weeks ago, Human Rights Watch issued a report on the murders of Colombia's social leaders and human rights defenders. It outlines practical actions and reforms the Colombian federal, state, and municipal governments could take to prevent, reduce, and even stop the murders and violence. Sadly, these recommendations were met with indifference, by hostility, or rejected out of hand. They were treated more like bad press than a serious attempt to offer help and provide a road map to interrupt the spiral of violence.\n\tThat is why I am calling on the Biden administration to make the protection of human rights defenders and social leaders one of America's highest priorities in its relationship with Colombia. The Biden administration and Congress should review the Human Rights Watch report and determine how U.S. policy and aid can advance the full implementation of the peace accord, support its protective and justice mechanisms, and help fulfill its promises of economic development in neglected areas.\n\tI call upon my colleagues to stand up for peace, for human rights, and for an end to the violence against human rights defenders and social leaders in Colombia. These courageous social leaders deserve nothing less than America's full and unconditional support.\n\n                          ____________________", "speakers": ["James P.

The Chair recognizes the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Costa) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on behalf of the \nAmerican Rescue Plan.\n  The critical need to provide economic relief for struggling Americans \nand communities across the Nation could never be more evident than it \nis now. A year into this pandemic, the world is reeling from the \nfallout of the coronavirus pandemic.\n  This time last year, we had a handful of people that had, sadly, \npassed away from COVID-19 as it slowly made its way across the country. \nThis week, we mourned over 500,000 lives lost and countless family \nmembers and loved ones that will be impacted forever, and we are still \nnot out of the woods. Yesterday evening, we appropriately honored and \nrecognized those Americans who lost their lives.\n  This pandemic has created a deep economic crisis for American \nfamilies and small businesses. Economic inequities continue to \naccelerate, sadly. Our communities are hurting. They are hurting, and \nthe time for decisive action is now, just as we did in a bipartisan \neffort last year.\n  Think about it. America--America, the richest country in the world, \nand yet the numbers are staggering. Over 18 million Americans are \nreceiving unemployment benefits. Nearly 24 million Americans are going \nhungry, including 12 million children--12 million children. And nearly \n40 million Americans cannot afford to pay the rent and possibly face \neviction.\n  We must get more funding to our States and local governments so they \ncan help those immediately impacted. This will allow us to begin to \nopen our schools safely, which we must do, in addition to the rest of \nour economy. This is a key component of President Biden's American \nRescue Plan, which I support.\n  Now, let me repeat. The American Rescue Plan will work to keep \ncommunities safe and reopen schools with a robust vaccine plan for the \npublic and educators that has been absent until the last 6 weeks.\n  In my own circumstance, my own constituency, the city of Fresno, in \nthe heart of my district is facing a multi-million dollar budget \nshortfall. Like most cities across the country, they will be forced to \ncut jobs, including those of first responders, without Federal support. \nThe same is true in the communities of Madera and Merced, also in my \ndistrict.\n\n  The American Rescue Plan will bring nearly $200 million to these two \nlocal communities combined, providing critical relief needed to provide \nfunding for services their residents require, my constituents.\n  Now that vaccines are being administered, with millions inoculated so \nfar, we have to continue to build on that momentum, for gaining the \nupper hand over this disease is on the horizon if we stay the course \nand implement the plan the President has outlined.\n  But we must do more to help Americans than just providing \nvaccinations. Obviously, that is at the front lines, and we will \nproduce more vaccines in the next month and in the next 2 months so \nthat, as the President said, 300 million Americans, by this summer, \nwill have the ability to be vaccinated. But economic relief is part of \nthe necessity to help them, and the American Rescue Plan does that.\n  Now, I have heard some of my colleagues on the other side talk about \nthe concerns about the fiscal impacts to our economy. I am a Blue Dog. \nI believe that we need to have fiscal discipline, and I believe, after \nbeing here 17 years, that happens when Democrats are willing to deal \nwith expenditures and Republicans are willing to deal with revenues. \nAnd unless we do deal with those two things together it isn't going to \nhappen.\n  The last administration indebted this Nation over $7.5 trillion--$7.5 \ntrillion in the last 4 years. I didn't hear much discussion during that \ntime about the fiscal deficit. But I learned another thing in 17 years \nhere; when Democrats are in charge, the debt matters. But when \nRepublicans are in charge, who cares?\n  So let's get real about this deficit. America is hurting today, and \nit needs our support and it needs our help.\n  Over 140 executives of major American corporations are supporting \nthis plan. Over 140 of the major companies in America think that this \nis necessary, the $1.9 trillion, to get this economy going and to put \nour country back on a track that we can be safe from this pandemic.\n  So I urge my colleagues to do the right thing and to vote in favor of \nthe American Rescue Plan, as we did previous measures on a bipartisan \neffort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN\n\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. McGovern).

Congressman Lewis would have turned 81 this \nweekend. Congressman Lewis spent his life getting into good trouble.\n  At 21, he was one of the original 13 Freedom Riders. At 23, as the \nchairman of SNCC, he spoke at the March on Washington. At 25, he led \nthe march from Selma to Montgomery, in the process withstanding all the \nviolence and hatred local and State officials could throw at him.\n  Congressman Lewis went on to serve Atlanta on both the city council \nand in Congress for more than 35 years, becoming the conscience of the \nCongress.\n  The tireless work of heroes like John Lewis pushes me to continue \npursuing equitable and just policies. Over the past 2 years, our \ncountry has had a much-needed awakening to the systemic inequality \npeople of color face every single day.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nKansas (Mr. Mann) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank the farmers and ranchers \nwhose work does not stop.\n  Even in the face of extreme freezing temperatures this month, the \nlikes of which we have not seen in decades, Kansas stood strong and got \nthe job done.\n  The big First District of Kansas is one of the most productive \nagricultural areas in the country. The district is home to more than \n60,000 farms and is made up of farmers, ranchers, feedlot managers, \nnutritionists, ethanol producers, ag lenders, and agribusiness owners \nwho feed, fuel, and clothe the world.\n  I grew up in Quinter, and I spent thousands of hours on a tractor in \nfields and on horseback, doctoring cattle in our family's feed yard. I \nknow well agriculture's working conditions are demanding on a good day, \nbut especially so when our business partner, Mother Nature, is as \nunforgiving as she has been lately.\n  In the past month, Kansas spent 13 consecutive days with temperatures \nbelow freezing. This is a stretch of freezing temperatures we have not \nseen in our State for nearly 40 years.\n  But those who stand with snow up to their knees in the depths of \nwinter or haul water in the drought of summer know agriculture does not \ntake days off. No matter the temperature, our ag producers head to work \nlong before most of us are awake and stay out until many of us have \nalready laid our heads down at night.\n  They are people like Cody and Ashley Bornholdt of Inman, who bust ice \nby hand at all hours so their cattle have access to water and are still \nable to joke that after several days of negative\n\n[[Page H596]]\n\ntemperatures, zero degrees feels like a heat wave.\n  They are people like Gary Capoun of Alma, who delivers baby calves \nand hauls them on the floorboard of his pickup to someplace warmer \nwhere they can be bottle-fed to ensure that they get the nutrients \nneeded to grow and survive in the wind chills.\n  They are the men and women staying up through the night so a baby \nanimal gets a shot at life, a piece of equipment is ready to go early \nthe next morning, the neighboring producer has the help they need to \nmilk their herd, and so people like you and I have a safe and secure \nfood supply.\n  As many across the country learned this last spring, our food does \nnot come from a grocery store shelf. The importance of the agriculture \nand food supply chain cannot be overstated. This supply chain \nrepresents millions of people working every day in the U.S. It begins \nwith farmers, ranchers, and growers, and it includes food processors \nand manufacturers, shippers, transportation workers, and, finally, \nthose working in the grocery stores and restaurants. Each of these \npeople is vital in ensuring we have food on our plates.\n  While most of us in the ``Big First'' of Kansas know how important \nagriculture is, I know that message can sometimes be lost on the way to \nthe grocery store. So on behalf of Kansans and all Americans, I share a \nsincere thank-you to the farmers, ranchers, and producers who supply \nour food, fuel, and fiber.\n  Thank you. Thank you for pulling the baby calf out of the snowbank \nand nursing it back to life. Thank you for busting ice early and \nfeeding hay late. Thank you for putting the needs of your livestock \nbefore yourselves. Thank you for your never-ending, backbreaking days. \nThank you for, especially on cold days, working so hard for the extra \nhours and extra strength. Your efforts feed us and keep us warm, too.\n  It is an honor to represent you in the U.S. House of Representatives \nand on the House Agriculture Committee. May God bless you.\n\n\n                     Celebrating National FFA Week\n\n  Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I also rise today to celebrate National FFA \nWeek.\n  The national FFA organization was founded by a group of young farmers \nin 1928 as the Future Farmers of America. Their mission was to prepare \nfuture generations for the challenges of feeding the world.\n  Today, more than 760,000 blue corduroy jacket-wearing FFA members in \nmore than 8,700 chapters across the country, and more than 9,600 \nmembers in 220 chapters in Kansas alone, are still working hard to \nadvance our Nation's most critical industry, food and agriculture.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  These members are our future farmers, ranchers, engineers, doctors, \nlawyers, teachers, scientists, communicators, and businesspeople. They \nare the next generation of leaders.\n  This week, they will celebrate National FFA Week as a long-held \ntradition during George Washington's birthday to respect agriculture's \nheritage and recognize its future.\n  As a past chapter FFA president from Quinter, Kansas, and a proud FFA \nalumnus, I am honored to join nearly 80 of my colleagues to introduce \nH. Res. 150, expressing support for the designation of February 20 to \nFebruary 27, 2021, as National FFA Week, recognizing the important role \nof the National FFA Organization in providing the next generation of \nleaders who will change the world, and celebrating 50 years of National \nFFA Alumni and Supporters.\n  Kansas FFA and the National FFA Organization have had a profound \nimpact on me. FFA taught me belonging when I put on my FFA jacket the \nfirst time, responsibility when caring for my family's livestock in the \nbitter winters and drought-ridden summers, and pride in sharing about \nthe organization I love on the House floor today.\n  Because of FFA and the next generation of agriculture, I know our \nbrightest days are ahead.\n  Happy National FFA Week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "PRODUCERS WORKING HARD FOR AMERICA\n\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore.

This is a stretch of freezing temperatures we have not seen in our State for nearly 40 years.\n\tBut those who stand with snow up to their knees in the depths of winter or haul water in the drought of summer know agriculture does not take days off. No matter the temperature, our ag producers head to work long before most of us are awake and stay out until many of us have already laid our heads down at night.\n\tThey are people like Cody and Ashley Bornholdt of Inman, who bust ice by hand at all hours so their cattle have access to water and are still able to joke that after several days of negative temperatures, zero degrees feels like a heat wave.\n\tThey are people like Gary Capoun of Alma, who delivers baby calves and hauls them on the floorboard of his pickup to someplace warmer where they can be bottle-fed to ensure that they get the nutrients needed to grow and survive in the wind chills.\n\tThey are the men and women staying up through the night so a baby animal gets a shot at life, a piece of equipment is ready to go early the next morning, the neighboring producer has the help they need to milk their herd, and so people like you and I have a safe and secure food supply.\n\tAs many across the country learned this last spring, our food does not come from a grocery store shelf. The importance of the agriculture and food supply chain cannot be overstated. This supply chain represents millions of people working every day in the U.S. It begins with farmers, ranchers, and growers, and it includes food processors and manufacturers, shippers, transportation workers, and, finally, those working in the grocery stores and restaurants. Each of these people is vital in ensuring we have food on our plates.\n\tWhile most of us in the ``Big First'' of Kansas know how important agriculture is, I know that message can sometimes be lost on the way to the grocery store. So on behalf of Kansans and all Americans, I share a sincere thank-you to the farmers, ranchers, and producers who supply our food, fuel, and fiber.\n\tThank you. Thank you for pulling the baby calf out of the snowbank and nursing it back to life. Thank you for busting ice early and feeding hay late. Thank you for putting the needs of your livestock before yourselves. Thank you for your never-ending, backbreaking days. Thank you for, especially on cold days, working so hard for the extra hours and extra strength. Your efforts feed us and keep us warm, too.\n\tIt is an honor to represent you in the U.S. House of Representatives and on the House Agriculture Committee. May God bless you.\n\n\n                     Celebrating National FFA Week\n\n\tMr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I also rise today to celebrate National FFA Week.\n\tThe national FFA organization was founded by a group of young farmers in 1928 as the Future Farmers of America. Their mission was to prepare future generations for the challenges of feeding the world.\n\tToday, more than 760,000 blue corduroy jacket-wearing FFA members in more than 8,700 chapters across the country, and more than 9,600 members in 220 chapters in Kansas alone, are still working hard to advance our Nation's most critical industry, food and agriculture.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n\tThese members are our future farmers, ranchers, engineers, doctors, lawyers, teachers, scientists, communicators, and businesspeople. They are the next generation of leaders.\n\tThis week, they will celebrate National FFA Week as a long-held tradition during George Washington's birthday to respect agriculture's heritage and recognize its future.\n\tAs a past chapter FFA president from Quinter, Kansas, and a proud FFA alumnus, I am honored to join nearly 80 of my colleagues to introduce H. Res. 150, expressing support for the designation of February 20 to February 27, 2021, as National FFA Week, recognizing the important role of the National FFA Organization in providing the next generation of leaders who will change the world, and celebrating 50 years of National FFA Alumni and Supporters.\n\tKansas FFA and the National FFA Organization have had a profound impact on me. FFA taught me belonging when I put on my FFA jacket the first time, responsibility when caring for my family's livestock in the bitter winters and drought-ridden summers, and pride in sharing about the organization I love on the House floor today.\n\tBecause of FFA and the next generation of agriculture, I know our brightest days are ahead.\n\tHappy National FFA Week.\n\n                          ____________________", "speakers": ["Tracey Mann"], "citation": "167 Cong.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to \nexpress my deep disappointment on the bloated, partisan bill that my \ncolleagues are calling a COVID relief package.\n  That is the name on the bill, but the reality is far from it. The \nreality is that we just passed a $900 billion package in December. The \npackage wasn't perfect, but it was bipartisan. This one is not.\n  The reality is that hundreds of billions of dollars remain unspent. \nAs of last week, there were unofficial estimates of unspent or non-\ndisbursed relief that included $183 billion for another round of PPP; \n$199 billion for healthcare; $136 billion for expanded unemployment \ninsurance; and $46 billion for direct stimulus payments. That is money \nwe still have, unspent.\n  The reality is that this administration can't or won't even give \nCongress an honest estimate of where that money is and what they will \ndo with trillions more.\n  The reality is that this bill is not for emergency relief, but for \nleftwing spending programs years from now. Nearly half of the funds \nunder this bill won't be spent until 2022.\n\n[[Page H597]]\n\n  There are billions of dollars for State and local governments, mostly \nto blue States that impose costly lockdowns, even though California is \nreporting a $10 billion surplus; billions to bail out multiemployer \npension plans; billions for subsidies to cover the cost of rising \nObamaCare premiums; and a massive expansion of Medicaid with no reforms \nto address waste, fraud, and abuse within the program.\n  Meanwhile, a mere 1 percent of this is for vaccine distribution. \nReally? Maybe that is, perhaps, because the Trump administration, \nindeed, did have a plan for vaccine distribution.

This is not how you govern \nresponsibly. This is not a contest to see how much debt we can rack up \nfor whatever constituency or special interest you favor at the moment.\n  Americans don't want handouts. They want a vaccine. They want their \nbusinesses open. They want their kids back in school because they know \nit is safe, despite what the teachers' unions are saying. And they \ndon't want to be told to wear three masks after they get a vaccine.\n  If you want to work with Republicans, assess what has been spent and \nwhat hasn't and focus on small business relief that increases jobs \ninstead of killing them, then Republicans will be right there with you. \nUntil then, expect some serious opposition.\n\n\n      Recognizing the Tremendous Strength of the People in Houston\n\n  Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I also rise today to recognize the \ntremendous the strength of the people in Houston, who I am honored to \nrepresent in Congress.\n  As we all know, last week, an historic arctic blast hit most of the \nSouth, including the great State of Texas, plunging millions of Texans \ninto darkness. In the middle of freezing cold temperatures, people \nweren't able to heat their homes or access water. I personally had to \ngather water from a swimming pool in our apartment complex after our \nwater was shut off.\n  I know that many had it much, much worse than I did. But through it \nall, the community came together. My friend Jim McIngvale, known as \nMattress Mack, in Houston opened up his furniture store as a shelter \nlast week to give people in need a warm place to sleep, eat or just get \nout of the cold for a few hours.\n  There are countless others who stepped up. Plumbers helped their \nneighbors repair their pipes free of charge; food and water \ndistribution centers opened up across the city, including in my \ndistrict office; and people who had power used it minimally so \nelectricity could flow back to their neighbors faster.

The Thiokol Memorial Project maintains a beautiful exhibit in Kingsland, Georgia.\n\tAlthough it has been 50 years, the event and the victims will never be forgotten.\n\n\n                   Recognizing Pharmacies Nationwide\n\n\tMr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize pharmacies assisting in the COVID-19 vaccine administration across the country.\n\tThanks to former President Trump's Operation Warp Speed, the vaccine is now available to about 6,500 pharmacies nationwide. It is expected that the COVID-19 vaccine will eventually be shipped to roughly 40,000 pharmacies across the country.\n\tMany of the participating pharmacies have gone above and beyond in their administration of the vaccine doses. For instance, recently, at Costco in Oregon, an elderly couple scheduled vaccinations for themselves within 20 minutes and reported the efficiency and safety in receiving the doses.\n\tAs a lifelong pharmacist, I thoroughly understand the vital role pharmacists play in fighting viruses, from administering flu shots to COVID-19 vaccines.\n\tMr. Speaker, I want to thank all participating pharmacies for their diligent work in ensuring safe and effective vaccine administration across the country. We can look forward to a brighter future because of them.\n\n                          ____________________", "speakers": ["Earl L. \"Buddy\" Carter"], "citation": "167 Cong. Rec.

The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nGeorgia (Mrs. Greene) for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in defense of \nwomen, girls, and children.\n  I would like to talk about the Equality Act. It is a bill that we \nwill be voting on this week. It is a bill that was passed before, but \nit is a bill that needs to be struck down. This is a bill that will add \nsexual orientation and gender identity as protected classes under the \nFederal 1964 Civil Rights Act.\n  We live in a nation--thank God--that declares all of us equal. There \nshould not be discrimination of anyone in the United States of America, \nand I fully believe that. But I ask everyone to take pause and truly \nconsider what the Equality Act will do, because it has very serious \nconsequences.\n  You see, women have come very far in America and our rights are \nextremely important. The work of our grandmothers and mothers to \ndeclare women as equal and push our way into the workplace and into \nsports has been a remarkable achievement.\n  Voting, being able to own businesses, achieve education the same as \nmen in America is a gift that I feel so honored and blessed by. I know \nthat every American woman treasures this.\n\n                              {time}  1100\n\n  You see, the Equality Act will change all of that, because it will \nput trans rights above women's rights, above the rights of our \ndaughters, our sisters, our friends, our grandmothers, our aunts. It is \ntoo much.\n  Mr. Speaker, you see, as a woman, I have competed in sports, and I am \nso thrilled that I was able to do that, but I competed against \nbiological women. It is a wonderful thing to be able to compete and \nprove yourself. Competition is a great, great thing. Little girls all \nover the country play sports. They play their hearts out, they \npractice, they enjoy time with their friends, then they compete at \nhigher levels where they can earn scholarships, where they can go to \ncollege and achieve and receive an education through playing a sport \nfor their university or college.\n  There are women that move on into professional sports fields and do \nremarkable things, incredible things for women. For example, Florence \nGriffith Joyner became the fastest woman in the world in 1988 when she \nran the 100-meter dash in 10.49 seconds. I could only dream of being \nthat fast. But in 2019, Matthew Boling caught the fastest high school \n100-meter time ever in 9.98 seconds, an entire half-second quicker than \nthe fastest woman in the world.\n  Biological women cannot compete against biological men. Biological \nlittle girls cannot compete against biological little boys. And they \nshouldn't have to.\n  I have a daughter that is a D-1 athlete. We traveled the country for \n10 years where she competed at the highest level. She earned her \nscholarship, and now she plays fast-pitch softball. And I can't tell \nyou how much fun I had watching her play this weekend, and she had a \nhome run. But if she has to compete against boys in her sport, not only \nwill they be on her playing field and she has to compete against them; \nthey will be in her locker room; they will be in her showers; they will \nbe in her bathroom; they will be in her hotel room when she travels \nwith her team--all under the Equality Act. This is wrong.\n  Mr. Speaker, this isn't about political parties. It is not about \nDemocrat, Republican. This is about right and wrong. This is about \ngirls' and women's rights.\n  Furthermore, it affects women in prison. Trans men, biological men \nthat identify as women, will be put with women in prison.\n  Battered women's shelters, women that have been beaten and abused by \nmen will have men in their battered women's shelters.\n  Drug rehab centers--and the list goes on and on.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is one thing to stop discrimination of a class of \npeople, but it is another thing to completely violate and destroy the \nrights of girls and women in order to achieve this. This bill must be \nstruck down. It is completely wrong.\n  Furthermore, we are in an institution where it says, ``In God we \ntrust.'' Well, it says in Genesis: God created us male and female. In \nhis image, he created us. Science has two sets of chromosomes that \nprove male and female.\n  Mr. Speaker, 80 to 95 percent of children with gender dysphoria \ncompletely outgrow it after puberty. The Equality Act will force \ndoctors and nurses to perform mastectomies on girls that want to have \ntheir breasts removed. It will force doctors also to perform abortions, \nbecause according to the Equality Act, a doctor cannot say no.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask that everyone please pause and consider, and vote \n``no'' for the Equality Act. We can't do this in America, and it needs \nto stop with political parties.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "EQUALITY ACT NEEDS TO BE STRUCK DOWN\n\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore.

Their victory in the other branches was also tight, 50/50 on \nthe Senate side.\n  Usually, when one party has a tiny majority, they recognize that \ngoverning requires compromise. Not this majority.\n  Less than 2 months into controlling the House, despite promising to \nsolve problems and restore democracy, Democrats have proven that their \nprimary goal is not governing but grievance, the politics of \ncensorship, not common ground.\n  In January, they eliminated the motion to recommit, the last chance \nfor the minority to improve legislation, without a single Republican \nvote. It will go down in history as the first time in the history of \nthis body that a majority did that, deny the minority, the millions of \nconstituents, their voice.\n  Already, millions have lost their voice in Congress due to the brazen \npartisanship. What Democrats are doing this week is even worse.\n  Today, they will hold a subcommittee hearing that will focus on \nbroadcasters' and cable news' devotion to journalistic integrity. This \nexplanation should concern every American.\n  It has never been Congress' role to define and enforce journalistic \nstandards. The First Amendment expressly prohibits the government from \ncontrolling what the press says.\n  But Democrats are trying to give themselves the power to dictate what \nyou can read and watch in your own home. And their assault on free \nspeech goes beyond today's disgraceful hearing.\n  On Monday, Representatives Eshoo and McNerney sent a letter to 12 \ncable, streaming, and satellite companies, essentially threatening them \nto remove ``Fox News'', ``Newsmax'', and ``One America News Network'' \nfrom their airways.\n  Here is just a quick snapshot of the answers they are demanding from \nthe carriers:\n  ``What moral or ethical principles do you apply in deciding which \nchannels to carry or when to take adverse actions against a channel?''\n  ``What steps did you take to monitor, respond to, and reduce the \nspread of disinformation, including encouragement or incitement of \nviolence by channels your company disseminates to millions of \nAmericans?''\n  Then the other question, coming from Congress in a majority of a \ncommittee: ``Are you planning to continue to carry `Fox News', \n`Newsmax', `One America News Network', both now and beyond any contract \nrenewal date? If so, why?''\n  Now, I am not an attorney, but some people have asked me, does that \nreach an ethical complaint against these Members by using undue \ninfluence?\n  I don't know. I guess the Ethics Committee would have to decide that.\n  These are Members of Congress who are using their official position \nto coerce and control the information Americans can watch and access in \ntheir own homes. They are demanding more censorship, more \ndeplatforming, and more control of what Americans can watch.\n  In their letter, Congresswoman Eshoo and Congressman McNerney suggest \nthat censorship is necessary because conservative views are not only \ndifferent, but they are dangerous. This is not only false; it is the \nsame script used in countries like China to silence speech they \ndisagree with.\n  Democrats would bring those same socialist standards to America, but \nthose standards are dangerous, vague, and easily abused. They have no \nplace here.\n  Democrats' action this week make it clear that the greatest threat to \nfree speech today is not a law from Congress, which is bound by the \nFirst Amendment. The greatest threat is politicians who bully private \ncompanies to silence dissenting views.\n  The sad part is it isn't only Democrats who have done this. They sent \na letter to a company of Amazon that was created to sell books, to tell \nthem not to sell books.\n  Lastly, beyond these serious threats to free speech, the irony of \nDemocrats' actions this week should not be lost on us. For the last 4 \nyears, we were told that the greatest danger to free speech was \nPresident Trump.\n  To underscore this accusation, the liberal legacy newspaper in \nWashington adopted its first official slogan: ``Democracy dies in \ndarkness.''\n  As usual, the heated rhetoric from the other side was off base--\nbadly. The same party that is now worried about misinformation rumor \nmills and conspiracy theory hotbeds was comfortable with endorsing \ndestructive and false narratives for 4 years.\n  Back in August, Congresswoman Eshoo herself basically alleged that \nthe Trump administration was intentionally attacking the U.S. Postal \nService. She called it election theft and a campaign of sabotage.\n  How about Congressman Adam Schiff? For years, he said he had more \nthan circumstantial evidence of Russian collusion. We all found that to \nbe false. Nevertheless, networks like ``MSNBC'' continue to perpetuate \nthe baseless accusation. I wonder if they sent a letter there.\n  Or how about our own Speaker Pelosi, who said in 2017, ``Our election \nwas hijacked. There is no question.''\n  Mr. Speaker, the American people are capable of making decisions \nabout how best to live their lives. They deserve to decide how to take \ncare of their families or open their businesses during a pandemic. And \nthey deserve to decide to watch the news, judge the information they \nchoose, and draw their own conclusions about its accuracy. They need us \nto trust them, not to try to control them.\n  If Democrats accepted robust debate, they would find that more people \nwould trust Washington.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a body that is using its power to try to \ndetermine\n\n[[Page H600]]\n\nwhat books can be printed, what shows can be seen, and what can be \nsaid.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have debated on this floor the things that happen in \nChina. And in China, if you try to buy an airline ticket you could have \nthe money, but they have an app there. And they say, first, we have to \ncheck.\n  They have had people in their own press that were told: I am sorry, \nyou can't take the plane.\n  Why?\n  You have said something that government doesn't like. You should \napologize.\n  The reporter apologized but the government thought it wasn't sincere \nenough.\n  To me, it is something I would fight because I believe in free \nspeech.\n  I thought that was farfetched in a faraway land. I never thought it \nwould be written on paper in the U.S. Congress, and the powerful \nmembers of a committee that oversees jurisdiction would threaten people \nof why they carry a network and will they carry that network in the \nfuture; and if so, why?\n  I never thought I would see Members of Congress use their power to \nthreaten others to go against the First Amendment.\n  Mr. Speaker, we will not stand for it, nor will the American public. \nThis is not a partisan issue; this is a constitutional issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "GOVERNING REQUIRES COMPROMISE\n\n  (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)\n\tMr. McCARTHY.

The gentlewoman from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized for 1 hour.\n\n[[Page H603]]\n\n  \n\n  Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the \ncustomary 30 minutes to the gentleman and my colleague from the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania (Mr. Reschenthaler), pending which I yield \nmyself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this \nresolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be \ngiven 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Rules Committee met and \nreported a rule, House Resolution 147, providing for consideration of \nH.R. 5, the Equality Act, under a closed rule. The rule provides 90 \nminutes of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and \nranking member of the Committee on the Judiciary and one motion to \nrecommit.\n  The rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 803, the Protecting \nAmerica's Wilderness and Public Lands Act, under a structured rule. The \nrule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the \nchair and ranking member of the Committee on Natural Resources and \nself-executes a manager's amendment from Chairman Grijalva. It also \nmakes in order 29 amendments, provides en bloc authority to Chairman \nGrijalva, and provides one motion to recommit.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are here today to debate the rule for two critical \npieces of legislation, H.R. 5, the Equality Act, and H.R. 803, the \nProtecting America's Wilderness and Public Lands Act.\n  This is a historic day for Congress and for equal rights. Over 45 \nyears ago, Congresswoman Bella Abzug introduced the first version of \nthe Equality Act, a bill that will provide full legal protections to \nLGBTQ people all across our country by extending the protections of the \nCivil Rights Act to them and making clear that we must respect, defend, \nand celebrate the dignity innate of everyone in our communities, \nincluding--and perhaps especially--those who are perceived as different \nor non-binary.\n  The version of the Equality Act that we consider today is the result \nof years of careful legislative drafting and amends existing civil \nrights laws to provide protection from discrimination based on sexual \norientation and gender identity in key areas of public life: \nemployment, housing, credit, education, public spaces and services, \nfederally funded programs, and jury service.\n  Additionally, the Equality Act updates the public spaces and services \ncovered in current law to include retail stores and services, such as \nbanks, legal services, and transportation. These important updates \nwould strengthen existing protections for everyone.\n  The journey to this final version of the Equality Act was led by a \ndear colleague who is a historymaker in his own right, co-chair of the \nLGBTQ Equality Caucus and my colleague on the Judiciary Committee, \nCongressman   David Cicilline of Rhode Island. Congressman Cicilline \nworked with lawyers and advocates from the left and the right, \nreligious groups, and a host of civil rights groups to make sure the \nlanguage of the Equality Act achieved full legal equality while \nprotecting existing civil rights for other marginalized groups.\n  The resulting bill is supported by 130 of the largest employees in \nthe country, our largest labor unions, and the hundreds of \norganizations including, to name just a few, the Leadership Conference \non Civil and Human Rights, the NAACP, the National Women's Law Center, \nthe Episcopal Church, the Union for Reform Judaism, and the United \nChurch of Christ.\n  And, most importantly, it is supported by a clear and overwhelming \nmajority of the American people. Seventy-one percent of Americans \nsupport this legislation, including majorities of Democrats, \nIndependents, and Republicans.\n  The clear majority of both the House and the American people \nrecognize that for too long LGBTQ people have faced discrimination with \nno Federal legal recourse. It is beyond dispute that LGBTQ people--\nespecially transgender people and, even more so, transgender women of \ncolor--face discrimination across this country.\n  To echo other speakers, this issue is deeply personal for me. It has \nbeen personal since my baby sister came out to me almost 40 years ago. \nFor many people all across this country and across this House, that is \nwhen this fight hits home.\n  It gets personal when someone whom you love says: This is who I am.\n  It gets personal when you know and value that person and you want to \ndo whatever you can to make sure that your loved one can live their \nlife to the fullest, free from hate and discrimination.\n  I am sad to say that my home, Pennsylvania, is one of the 30 States \nthat defies the will of its people by not having legal protections for \nLGBTQ people. The idea that my sister--someone who put her life on the \nline for our country when she served in our Armed Forces--could drive \nacross State lines and lose protections is heartbreaking.\n  The Equality Act ends the patchwork of State laws and creates \nuniform, nationwide protections. LGBTQ people won't have to worry that \nbeing transferred to another State by their employer or needing to move \nhome to take care of ailing parents will cause them to lose civil \nrights protections. From sea to shining sea, LGBTQ people will have the \nsecurity and stability that comes from knowing that, if they face \ndiscrimination, they have legal recourse.\n  It is also important to note what the Equality Act does not do. The \nEquality Act does not impinge on religious freedom. Religious liberty \nis a cornerstone value of our Constitution and our country. Religious \norganizations are currently able to prefer their own members and their \nversion of morality in hiring for religious positions, such as \nministers and schoolteachers. The Equality Act does nothing to change \nthat. The Equality Act does not force anyone to perform or obtain \nabortions in violation of their religious beliefs, and it does not \nstrip girls of their title 9 protections.\n  The Equality Act does clarify what has long been held: That religious \nfreedom laws do not create an exemption to civil rights laws.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  Just like a person can't use a claim of religious freedom to refuse \nto sell a house to an interracial couple, under the Equality Act LGBTQ \nfamilies will be protected from discrimination regardless of its \nmotivation.\n  Consider the stakes facing LGBTQ people too often all across this \ncountry. A same-sex couple walks into a restaurant. Having hired a \nbabysitter to look after their young children, they are hoping to have \na relaxing night out. But, instead, when they are seated and looking at \nthe menu, the manager comes over and tells them that they have to \nleave. They aren't welcome.\n  This kind of insecurity and humiliation occurs on a daily basis \nacross this country, and in 30 States the couple would have no legal \nrecourse. Often, humiliation is just the tip of the iceberg. Same-sex \ncouples are far more likely to be denied housing; qualified and high-\nperforming transgender people are more likely to be fired from their \njobs; and LGBTQ young people face rejection and discrimination in \nschool, which can deny them an education.\n  These injuries compound and lead to poverty, homelessness, and \nviolence. The impact is felt the hardest by transgender women of color, \nwho confront racial discrimination, sex discrimination, and gender \nidentity discrimination. The intersection of these forms of \ndiscrimination is all too often deadly.\n  The protections provided by the Equality Act give LGBTQ people an \nequal chance at the American Dream. While discrimination and rejection \nhas ended the lives of too many transgender people, many are succeeding \ndespite discrimination.\n  We are talking here about the civil rights of our friends, our \nfamily, and public servants. In Pennsylvania, Dr. Rachel Levine, a \ntransgender woman, served in the Governor's cabinet as Secretary for \nHealth, and has recently been nominated by President Biden to serve as \nAssistant Health Secretary.\n  Mara Keisling, a Pennsylvania native, is the founder and Executive \nDirector of the National Center for\n\n[[Page H604]]\n\nTransgender Equality and a pioneer for civil rights protections.\n  Sarah McBride was recently sworn in as the first transgender Senator \nin the State of Delaware.\n  And of course, Pete Buttigieg was recently sworn in as the U.S. \nSecretary of Transportation, becoming the first openly gay cabinet \nmember to be confirmed by the Senate.\n  Opponents of the Equality Act keep trying to pit cisgender girls \nagainst transgender girls, when really this legislation is about \nstrengthening opportunity for all girls and women. Whether it is \nwomen's sports, single-sex colleges, or homeless services for women, \nthe Equality Act simply prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual \norientation and gender identity in these areas. It doesn't undermine \nthese institutions or prohibit them; it simply ensures that they are \ninclusive of all women and girls, including trans women and girls.\n  Support for this legislation is overwhelming and deserves an \noverwhelmingly positive response from this body. I encourage all of my \ncolleagues to support the rule and underlying legislation, and further \nencourage the Senate to swiftly act to pass this bill so that we can \nfinally provide firm, statutory protections to the LGBTQ community.\n  Next, Mr. Speaker, is H.R. 803, the Protecting America's Wilderness \nand Public Lands Act. This is a package of public bills from the \nNatural Resources Committee that will designate more than 1.5 million \nacres as wilderness areas, and more than 1,200 river miles into the \nNational Wild and Scenic Rivers System.\n  The bill would also withdraw more than 1.2 million acres of public \nland from new drilling and mining, ensuring that iconic landscapes like \nthe Grand Canyon and Colorado's Thompson Divide are permanently \nprotected for future generations to enjoy.\n  Few things in the United States are as universally cherished by \nAmericans as are our public lands. Our country is home to more than 111 \nmillion acres of designated wilderness, and these lands help us combat \nclimate change, provide for an array of ecological diversity, and offer \nrecreational activities to Americans young and old.\n  As we continue to endure the devastating effects of climate change, \nproviding for millions of additional acres of wilderness will allow for \nthese areas to continue to serve as critical ``carbon sinks'' to \ncapture and mitigate carbon dioxide in our atmosphere.\n  A similar version of this legislation passed the House last Congress, \nbut this version includes a critical new piece from Natural Resources \nCommittee Chairman Grijalva, the Grand Canyon Protection Act. This bill \nwould permanently ban new mining claims on approximately one million \nacres of public land surrounding Grand Canyon National Park, while \nhelping to protect the clean water resources critical to the \nlivelihoods of local Tribal communities.\n  The Grand Canyon Protection Act was developed by Chairman Grijalva in \nclose consultation with all of the relevant stakeholders in his \ndistrict and serves to protect one of the most cherished places in the \nUnited States.\n  You may hear my colleague from Pennsylvania argue that this bill is \nnothing but a land grab, an attempt to subvert private industry. Of \ncourse, this couldn't be farther from the truth.\n  Mining, like every other industry, is subject to the whim of the free \nmarket. Historically, when the demand for these minerals has dropped, \nmining companies are all too prepared to skip town without cleaning up \nany of their mess.\n  This bill isn't about whether or not nuclear energy and its inputs \nwill be part of our clean energy future, but if we want to ensure that \nit is, then I would recommend that we first start by supporting \neffective regulations on new and existing nuclear plants and their \ncapabilities. The best way to ensure demand for a product is to \nsimilarly ensure that its user won't decide it isn't worth pursuing or \nis unaffordable.\n  The merits of nuclear energy aside, you can't deny that its use in \nthis country is on the downswing or, at the very least, stagnant. This \nisn't due to over-regulation; it is due to under-regulation. It is due \nto massive cost overruns and incompetent government oversight.\n  The U.S. has had only one new nuclear reactor become operational in \nthe last 20 years. This isn't because a mining company or two hasn't \nbeen afforded the opportunity to desecrate our national resources, but \nbecause the U.S. has not yet proven we can responsibly operate a \nnuclear plant that, from start to finish, is safe and has the trust of \nthe American people.\n  Public lands do not belong to those only in the Congressional \ndistrict in which they are located; they belong to all of us. \nWilderness areas in the great State of Colorado belong to you and me as \nmuch as Independence Hall belongs to a native of Colorado. We all have \na role to play in protecting these lands and seeking carveouts for \nmining companies is not the right way forward.\n  I want to especially thank my colleague, Congresswoman Diana DeGette, \nfor her tireless and bipartisan work in getting this legislation to \nsuch a great place.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from my home State of \nPennsylvania for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.\n  Mr. Speaker, the rule before us provides for the consideration of two \npieces of legislation. Let's just look at both pieces one at a time.\n  The first bill, H.R. 5, the Equality Act, provides for civil rights \nprotections for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer \nindividuals.\n  Let me start by saying that Republicans believe all people should be \ntreated equally under the law. Let me repeat that. Republicans believe \nall people should be treated equally under the law. But the Equality \nAct misses that mark.\n  Rather, H.R. 5 represents a radical departure from existing civil \nrights protections that will have significant implications on everyday \nlife, and eliminate laws ensuring women and girls have the same \nopportunities as men and boys.\n  Just take student athletics. H.R. 5 would redefine sex to include \ngender identity, meaning a transgender woman, a person who was born \ngenetically male but identifies as a woman, could not be barred from \nparticipating in girls' or women's athletics.\n  Further, I have concerns that, due to the lack of committee action, \nthis bill has not been fully thought out and it may be difficult, \nfrankly, if not impossible, to actually implement in line with \ncongressional intent.\n  Perhaps the most pressing example of this is the term ``gender \nidentity,'' which is so vague that even the special interest groups \nbacking this bill cannot agree on a single definition of that.\n  Lastly, I am troubled that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act is \nnot applicable under this measure. Without this vital protection, \nchurches, synagogues, mosques, and religiously affiliated schools will \nbe forced to act contrary to their deeply held beliefs or stop offering \ncertain services to the public.\n  Religious freedom was once an issue that all Americans, regardless of \npolitical party, strongly supported. It is incredibly disappointing to \nsee my colleagues across the aisle abandon this principle in an effort \nto appease their far-left radical progressive base.\n  Mr. Speaker, the second part of this rule provides for consideration \nof H.R. 803, the Protecting America's Wilderness and Public Lands Act. \nThis legislation consists of 8 natural resources bills, and will create \nnearly 1.5 million acres of wilderness, establish the most restrictive \nFederal land use classification, as well as lock up rivers and other \nlands across four western States.\n  Like all my Republican colleagues, I strongly support responsible \npreservation of our Nation's natural resources. Remember, it was \nRepublican Teddy Roosevelt who started this movement.\n  However, my colleagues across the aisle have ignored this and have \ngone way too far. This bill takes a partisan approach to public land \nprotection, and not a single Republican has cosponsored the underlying \nmeasures.\n  Further, some of the lands affected by this legislation lie in \ncongressional districts where Members of Congress do not support such \nactions. These Members have not had the opportunity to share their \nopposition or their concerns, as bills in H.R. 803 were not marked up \nby this Congress.\n\n[[Page H605]]\n\n  H.R. 803 also ignores input from local communities, who voiced \nconcern that these measures will hurt local economies and rural jobs. \nAs we recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, the last thing that we should \nbe doing is eliminating good-paying, family-sustaining jobs.\n  Further, this bill will actually increase catastrophic wildfires, as \nthe new wilderness and scenic river designations prohibit scientific \nforest management.\n  I am especially concerned that this measure withdraws 1.2 million \nacres from mineral production, including uranium, a necessary component \nfor the U.S. nuclear reactor fleet.\n  Currently, our Nation is relying on China for the vast majority of \nrare earth elements and critical materials, which are necessary for \neverything from building a fighter jet to a cell phone.\n  Just last week, we saw China threaten to cut off its mineral supply \nto American defense contractors. We have watched as China has done this \nto sister democracies such as Japan.\n  This bill will give the Chinese Communist Party, and other unstable \nand hostile regimes, control over our energy and mineral needs, putting \nour economic and national security at risk.\n  We must not cut off access to the minerals and materials necessary \nfor everyday life and for the protection of our Nation.\n\n  I would urge my colleagues across the aisle to seek a bipartisan \napproach to these two bills, to this rule, not just today, but also in \nthe weeks and months ahead.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the rule, and I reserve the balance \nof my time.\n  Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. McGovern), the distinguished chairman of the Rules \nCommittee.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania, \na distinguished member of the Rules Committee, for yielding me the \ntime; and I want to thank her for her eloquent opening.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are just weeks away from the 53rd anniversary of \nMartin Luther King, Jr.'s famous speech at the National Cathedral. That \nis when he uttered the powerful line, ``The moral arc of the universe \nis long, but it bends towards justice.''\n  In many ways, those words are as misconstrued as they are well-known, \nbecause some have taken them to mean that if you just wait long enough, \njustice is inevitable. Dr. King knew better, though. He knew that for \nthe moral arc to bend, people needed to be courageous enough to \nactually bend it.\n  Just 6 years after this line was spoken, Members of this Chamber \nshowed that courage when they introduced the original Equality Act. \nThey did so in the shadow of the Stonewall riots, at a time when even \ndiscussing LGBTQ issues publicly was seen by many as taboo.\n  These Members recognized the fundamental unfairness in a patchwork of \nState laws being used to deny some Americans fundamental rights like \njobs and homes, just because of who they were or who they loved.\n\n                              {time}  1400\n\n  They had the backbone to act, giving a voice in these hallowed Halls \nto the many advocates nationwide fighting for equality from the \noutside.\n  Getting to this point has been a long, long, long road, and I am a \nproud cosponsor of the Equality Act that is before us today, and I have \npushed for this day for a long time. I know this hasn't been easy. So \nmany people and so many organizations, though, never wavered. And along \nthe way, they changed hearts and minds on this issue.\n  What may have been a radical idea then is not now. In fact, most \npeople today not only support such protections for LGBTQ Americans, \nthey incorrectly believe that they are already in place. That is how \ncommon sense this bill is, Mr. Speaker.\n  This House made history when it passed the Equality Act for the first \ntime last Congress, and we did so in a bipartisan way. Unfortunately, \nit didn't even get a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate, and the \nprior Republican President didn't support it. But now we have new \nleadership in the Senate and a President who has made passing this bill \na top priority.\n  This moment represents our best chance yet to finally make the \nEquality Act the law of the land. This moment, Mr. Speaker, is an \nopportunity to bend the moral arc toward justice, toward fairness, and \ntoward equality, and I encourage all of my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to seize it.\n  Let's support this rule and the underlying bill, and let's take a \nhistoric step forward toward building a more fair and just society for \nall Americans.\n  Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom Arizona (Mrs. Lesko), my good friend.\n  Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule.\n  The underlying legislation we are considering in this rule is wrought \nwith concerning provisions. One underlying bill, H.R. 803, is just \nanother land grab that will kill jobs, make our Nation hostage to \nhostile foreign powers, restrict public access and recreation \nopportunities on our public lands, and threaten our energy \nindependence.\n  Specifically, in my home State of Arizona, this bill has dangerous \nimplications for our mining industry. These provisions also threaten \nour national security by making the United States reliant on foreign \nnations for critical minerals.\n  The other bill in this rule, the so-called Equality Act, is anything \nbut equal. In fact, it is a threat to women's privacy and safety. This \nbill effectively outlaws facilities reserved for biological females. \nThis includes restrooms, showers, and locker rooms. And outrageously, \nthis also includes women's domestic violence shelters.\n  As a survivor myself of domestic violence, I know the importance of \nthese women's shelters. They are critical for women who are trying to \nescape domestic violence and sometimes sexual assault. Under this \nEquality Act, a man, a biological man, identifying as a woman cannot \nlegally be turned away from any of these facilities.\n  Women will lose all rights to bodily privacy, safety, and security. \nVulnerable women across America deserve better, Mr. Speaker.\n  In addition, this bill will end girls sports as we know it by \nmandating schools accept males into girls sports.\n  I stand in opposition to both of the underlying bills, and I urge my \ncolleagues to vote ``no'' on this rule.\n  Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I would just note for the record that over \n20 States already have versions of this law, the Equality Act, with \nrespect to participation in sports, as do the Olympics, and we have not \nseen the kind of behavior that has just been suggested.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. \nBlumenauer).\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman's courtesy \nand her careful, thoughtful explanation of what we are doing.\n  I strongly support the Equality Act, extending civil rights \nprotections to all citizens. I have been honored to be a part of this \nprocess throughout my political career, dating back as a child \nlegislator in the 1970s in county government, in city government in \nOregon, and for the last 25 years here in Congress.\n  The arguments that we are hearing have been heard before. The same \nsort of hysterical concerns have proven not to be the case. Wild claims \nhave been proven wrong; and especially I think of marriage equality as \nthe most compelling. Each reform, each step of the way, has been for \nprogress, and equality was positive, and ultimately supported by the \npublic, as is the Equality Act. The wild claims have been proven \ngroundless.\n  At the end of the day, one of the reasons is that Americans are \nbiased in favor of fairness and equality. Another important reason, as \nalluded to by my friend from Pennsylvania, is personal experience. \nThere was fear and misapprehension, but as people became experienced \nwith a family member who married, a transgender child, when you deal \nwith the reality of real people, what we find is that they are people \nlike everybody else, and we do not want their lives to be turned upside \ndown.\n\n  I come from a State where by and large these protections are in \nplace, but they aren't in place for everybody everywhere, and we have \nan opportunity to make additional progress. One of the reasons that we \nhave seen\n\n[[Page H606]]\n\nthis progress take place is the advocacy of those in the LGBT community \nwho have been tireless, thoughtful, articulate, strategic, moving the \nagenda forward and bringing along often reluctant politicians.\n  Last but not least, I would reference what happened with our young \npeople. Young people understand this. Young people are not hysterical. \nYoung people express their concern and willingness to embrace others, \nregardless of sexual orientation, and that is why ultimately this cause \nwill win. It is why so much progress has been made and why it will \nultimately be successful.\n  I deeply appreciate this being brought before us, an opportunity for \nus to approve the Equality Act, affirm the bedrock principle of full \nequality, move it on to the Senate, and hopefully now with an \nadministration committed to equality, we can enact it into law for the \nbenefit of citizens all across the country.\n  I just have one 30-second evaluation of the notion of scientific \nforest management.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Cuellar). The time of the gentleman has \nexpired.\n  Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the \ngentleman from Oregon.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I will just say, I come from an area \nwhere so-called ``scientific management'' of forests has resulted in \nmore forest fires, problems with water quality, problems with habitat. \nWe are learning that we need to make different changes, and one of the \ntools that we have is extending wilderness protection. It strengthens \nthe environment, protects wildlife, water resources, and makes them \nmore resilient, not less.\n  It is not a matter of raking the forests, as Donald Trump said, but \nhaving an opportunity to allow the healing power of nature to provide \nthose protections.\n  Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Virginia (Mr. Good).\n  Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, in their continued relentless \nassault on religious freedoms, Democrats are trying today, with this \nterrible bill, to make wholesale and damaging changes to our Nation's \ncivil rights laws with little to no debate or even discussion on how \nthis legislation will affect the daily lives of Americans and the \ninstitutions we hold dear.\n  While the Equality Act purports to be an inclusive piece of \nlegislation, it is actually exclusive of those with a different \nviewpoint. It would ultimately put civil rights laws at odds with \nlongstanding religious beliefs pertaining to sex, sexuality, and other \nmoral issues.\n  The result would be that faith-based nonprofits, such as a Christian \nshelter for women or an adoption agency or other religiously affiliated \nproviders of social services, could not minister in good conscience \nwithout suffering consequences under Federal law.\n  We have past history as a precedent, an ominous precedent, as we saw \nthe Obama-Biden administration seek to close down the Little Sisters of \nthe Poor and Catholic nuns who care for the dying simply because they \nwould not pay for their employees' contraception or drugs inducing \nabortion.\n  A vote for the Equality Act would solidify the Biden-Harris \nadministration's efforts to enforce the same radical religious and \nmoral litmus tests that leave no room for faith-based ministries and \norganizations to operate without subscribing to the dogma of the left.\n  The Equality Act essentially weaponizes civil rights laws against \nAmericans' fundamental liberties, and we must reject this assault on \nour most precious of freedoms. I oppose this rule, and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I would just restate that this act does not \ntake away any of the religious freedoms that are already enshrined in \nmultiple laws. It does not change those laws.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman \nfrom Georgia (Mrs. Greene).\n  Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, in the spirit of the debate here \nfor the rule, there seems to be quite a disagreement between each side \nover what exactly this bill says, so for a parliamentary question, I \nwould like to request that the entire bill be read.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman's request will not be \nentertained.\n  Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Well, then, let's read some of the rules. You \nkeep saying it doesn't violate religious freedoms when, in fact, it \ndoes. It says so directly here in the bill in these sections, and it is \na shame that we aren't reading the exact text because it is the text \nthat matters. It doesn't matter what you have to say or what I have to \nsay. It is the actual wording.\n  In section 1107, it actually talks about: ``The Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act of 1993 shall not provide a claim concerning, or a \ndefense to a claim under, a covered title, or provide a basis for \nchallenging the application or enforcement of a covered title.''\n  This bill, in the text, also specifically talks about: ``With respect \nto gender identity, an individual shall not be denied access to a \nshared facility, including a restroom, a locker room, and a dressing \nroom, that is in accordance with the individual's gender identity.''\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to \nthe gentlewoman from Georgia just to close.\n\n  Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, in the wording in the text of \nthe bill of the Equality Act, it also says: ``With respect to sex, \npregnancy, childbirth or a related medical condition shall not receive \nless favorable treatment than other physical conditions.''\n  As a parliamentary question, what does that mean? Does that mean that \nanyone can demand an abortion? And it is discrimination to be refused \nthis medical service?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has again \nexpired.\n  Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, with respect to the gentlewoman's question, \nwith respect to the language in question, it has long been held by our \ncourts that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act does not apply to \ncivil rights laws.\n  The Equality Act looks to treat discrimination against LGBTQ \nindividuals the same way as other forms of discrimination, including \nracial discrimination. So, these arguments just don't hold water.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman \nfrom the great State of Texas (Mr. Pfluger).\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to both bills. \nHowever, I am here to talk about the partisan Federal land grab \npackage.\n  Last week, my home State of Texas endured a harrowing winter storm \nthat wiped out electricity and water for millions of Texans. It \ndevastated homes and businesses and caused irreparable damage to \nlivestock, crops, and industry production across the State. Tragically, \nsome even lost their lives.\n  Our State was under an extreme emergency. Living through that \nunderscored the need for safe, affordable, reliable energy. We \nabsolutely must have a reliable baseload for our energy grids and a \nlevel playing field for all forms of energy. The Federal Government \ncannot pick favorites in energy.\n  What happened in Texas should shake our country into the realization \nthat, as our population grows and our energy needs expand, any move to \nlimit production will have dire consequences on our safety and our \nnational security.\n  Unfortunately, this bill is another step in the vendetta to limit the \nAmerican energy production. The partisan $1.2 million Federal land \ngrab----\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to \nthe gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, the land grab is another Democrat attempt \nto restrict our country's abundant natural resources under onerous \nregulations that will kill jobs in the energy industry and put \nAmericans at risk.\n  This is a matter of national security, and I urge my colleagues to \nvote against this bill and to vote for the\n\n[[Page H607]]\n\nsafety and energy independence that this country so deserves. Please \njoin me in voting ``no'' for both bills and both rules.\n  Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I would just note that what we saw in Texas \nthis past week was a truly astonishing, unusual snowstorm with frigid \ncold conditions that are not normal--as the Speaker knows--in Texas, \nand that happens because of climate change.\n  Because we haven't done enough to protect our wilderness and to \nprotect our environment, we end up with extreme climate events like we \njust saw, and this bill is a step toward redressing that imbalance.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an \namendment to the rule to immediately consider H.R. 682, the Reopen \nSchools Act.\n  I will do this to ensure that the $54.3 billion that Congress \nappropriated just last month to help schools reopen is, in fact, \nprioritized to meet the expenses of actually being able to open up \nschools for in-person learning.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record the \ntext of my amendment, along with any extraneous material, immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom Iowa (Mrs. Hinson), who will explain the amendment.\n  Mrs. HINSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose the previous question. This is \nthe third time here today that Republicans have called on this body to \nconsider my bill, the Reopen Schools Act. It is a commonsense solution \nto get students and teachers to return to the classroom and to do it \nsafely.\n  This legislation would condition a portion of State COVID relief \ngrants for education on schools actually reopening. My Democrat \ncolleagues already voted for these funds to be used specifically for \nschools to reopen safely back in December, $54 billion.\n  The science on this is definitive. If certain safety precautions are \ntaken, teachers and students can resume in-person learning safely. So \nthat is why Congress sent the States this money back in December.\n  But after nearly a year of this pandemic lockdown, millions of \nstudents are still learning exclusively from behind a screen. Our \nchildren are struggling academically and they are falling behind.\n  But the toll on mental health is what is most concerning to me. Even \nafter a year, many kids haven't seen their school friends. They haven't \nbeen out to play on a playground. They are isolated, disconnected, and \nthey are lonely. From increased stress and anxiety, depression, even \nsuicidal thoughts or attempts, our youngest generation is facing a \nmental health crisis.\n  Hospitals have seen a staggering increase in mental health \nemergencies among young children. It is heartbreaking. And the longer \nthe goal posts continue to be moved on reopening schools, the worse \nthis mental health crisis for our young people will become.\n  My home State of Iowa is leading the way to put students' education \nand mental health first. My two sons got on the school bus this morning \nin Iowa. They are in class right now receiving hands-on attention from \ntheir teachers, and they will play with their friends at recess today.\n  As a parent, I am grateful that I had the ability to make the right \nchoice for my children and send them back to class to learn in person. \nBut millions of parents around the country have not been given this \nchoice, with many school districts still only offering virtual \nlearning. I have heard of so many families who are struggling as \nschools remain shuttered and they have no clear timetable for \nreopening.\n  It is vulnerable families with at-risk children who are impacted the \nmost by these decisions. Let's think about the kids who don't have \naccess to a computer or WiFi to try to complete their lessons online. \nOr let's talk about the kids who rely on school breakfast and lunch and \nthey are going hungry without these vital nutrition programs. Or what \nabout the victims of child abuse and neglect who are locked in with \npotential abusers. Or kids who are left at home all day because their \nparents have no choice but to go to work.\n\n  We cannot allow children and families to continue to suffer right \nnow. It is time for students to get back into the classroom, and we can \ndo it safely. With the Reopen Schools Act, they will be able to do so \nsafely. Teachers will be back in the classroom safely, and we can get \nthis country moving forward again.\n  Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will \njoin me in supporting our students by defeating the previous question. \nWe need to get kids back to school. So I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. McGovern).\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  I have some good news for the gentlewoman who just spoke. The \nreconciliation bill that is coming to the floor, hopefully, on Friday \nwill have a whole bunch of resources in it to help States safely reopen \nschools. So I hope we will get a good bipartisan vote on that.\n  Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Ohio (Mr. Wenstrup), the good doctor.\n  Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the previous \nquestion. If the previous question is defeated, Republicans will amend \nthis rule to immediately consider H.R. 682, the Reopen Schools Act, \nwhich I am proud to cosponsor.\n  As a father of two small children, their overall health and well-\nbeing is my top priority; not just my children, but all of America's \nchildren. And as I have looked around this Chamber, I see lots of \nMembers on both sides of the aisle who I know to be great parents and \ngrandparents, and I know they want the best for their children, too.\n  I am also a doctor, and I am co-chair of our Doctors Caucus. \nThroughout this pandemic, we have heard calls from Members, and now \nfrom President Joe Biden, that we need to trust the science.\n  As a doctor, I wholeheartedly agree--and the science is clear--\nstudents and teachers can go back to in-person learning safely. I know \nthis because my own children have been fortunate enough to go back to \nschool in person all of this school year safely.\n  The American Academy of Pediatrics has stressed the importance of \nstudents returning to school for their overall health and well-being, \nand the CDC research is clear that transmission in schools is extremely \nlow.\n  Last week, I joined Congresswoman Hinson, Whip Scalise, and Ranking \nMember Foxx on a call with parents from all across the country who want \ntheir children to be able to go back to school. It was a bipartisan \nevent. To them, this wasn't a partisan issue. The parents on the call \nwere from across the entire political spectrum: Republicans, Democrats, \nand Independents.\n  We heard heartbreaking stories from them about some of their children \nfalling into depression, losing their reading comprehension, and \nstruggling to focus.\n  Kids are attempting or committing suicide at an alarming rate. In one \ncounty in Nevada, the suicide rate doubled from the previous year. \nHospitals across the country are seeing unprecedented increases in \nchildren suicide attempts and mental health admissions.\n  Yes, there is some risk to returning, but nothing in life is zero \nrisk. The consequences of staying closed are far too grave and our \nchildren are suffering both socially and academically because of it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the Reopen Schools Act because \nwe have given schools the funding needed to reopen safely. However, \nsome schools, seemingly under pressure from powerful teachers' unions, \nrefuse to return to in-person learning.\n  Congress has provided more than $54 billion in State COVID relief \ngrants for education to help reopen schools. We didn't, however, \nrequire the schools to actually reopen if they were to access the \nmoney, and that was a mistake.\n  Congresswoman Hinson's bill will address that issue by conditioning \nthose funds on States producing a reopening plan to get students back \nto school as quickly as possible.\n\n[[Page H608]]\n\n  There are at least 3 months left in most school years around the \ncountry. We can't just let schools put off returning to in-person \nlearning until next fall or later. We need to do what is best for our \nstudents, our children, our grandchildren, our nieces and nephews. We \nneed to reopen the schools now.\n  We can't, for example, expect sixth-grade teachers to teach fourth \ngraders.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to defeat the \nprevious question. I thank Congresswoman Hinson for her leadership on \nthis bill.\n  Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would just note, as a parent, a former school board member, and \neducation advocate, of course, we all want what is best for our \nstudents and what is best for our schools.\n  But I would also suggest that a one-size-fits-all, everybody has to \ngo back in person to schools does not serve anybody well.\n  We have seen around the country--first of all, our schools in \nPennsylvania are not closed. They are open. Some are virtual, some are \nhybrid, some are in person. But each community is doing what it needs \nto do in response to the conditions that are present at this time.\n  So I agree with my colleague on the Rules Committee that we \nabsolutely need to get our school districts and our State and local \ngovernments the money they need to safely reopen schools, and we are \nlooking forward to doing that with our reconciliation bill on Friday.\n  Mr. Speaker, I just inquire whether the gentleman from Pennsylvania \nis prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume. I have no further speakers and at this time, and I am prepared \nto close.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, Republicans believe everyone should be treated equally \nunder the law. But H.R. 5 is a radical approach that will have serious, \nunintended consequences for female athletes, victims of sexual \nviolence, houses of worship, and healthcare professionals. The list \ngoes on and on. Critically, the bill undermines important religious \nfreedom protections.\n  As for H.R. 803, let's call this what it is. It is a land grab. This \nis a land grab, which will kill jobs in rural communities. It will \nleave us vulnerable to hostile nations for our energy and mineral \nneeds. It will restrict access and recreation opportunities for the \nAmerican public.\n  For all these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the \nprevious question and ``no'' on the underlying measure.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, today, we are moving forward on two pieces of \nlegislation whose timely consideration is long overdue. And I would \nnote that H.R. 5 did pass last Congress with a bipartisan majority.\n  So we are looking forward, at long last, to passing the Equality Act \nthrough both Chambers and removing the burden of discrimination that \ncan move us closer to a country where members of the LGBTQ community \nhave an equal opportunity to achieve the American Dream.\n  The Equality Act isn't going to be the end of our long journey toward \nfull LGBTQ equality, but it will bring our laws into line across the \ncountry with values that our country was founded upon.\n  We must continually take steps to make our country more perfect. \nAcknowledging in law the challenges that actually face LGBTQ people and \ntaking concrete action to correct them brings us another step closer.\n  Mr. Speaker, we will pass the Protecting America's Wilderness and \nPublic Lands Act in order to ensure that the sacred lands that all \nAmericans share equally cannot be tarnished for the benefit of a few.\n  We have a long way to go in addressing the myriad problems facing \nthis country, but the two bills before us today are a strong and \nnecessary start to helping our Nation live up to its full potential.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous \nquestion.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. Reschenthaler is as \nfollows:\n\n                   Amendment to House Resolution 147\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following:\n       Sec. 6. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the \n     House shall resolve into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     682) to encourage local educational agencies to resume in-\n     person instruction at elementary and secondary schools, and \n     for other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be \n     dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of \n     the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the \n     bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and \n     controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the \n     Committee on Education and Labor. After general debate the \n     bill shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute \n     rule. All points of order against provisions in the bill are \n     waived. When the committee rises and reports the bill back to \n     the House with a recommendation that the bill do pass, the \n     previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill \n     and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening \n     motion except one motion to recommit. If the Committee of the \n     Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution on \n     the bill, then on the next legislative day the House shall, \n     immediately after the third daily order of business under \n     clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole \n     for further consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 7. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 682.\n\n  Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous \nquestion.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. RESCHENTHALER.

The gentlewoman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 1 hour. \n  \n\n\tMs. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman and my colleague from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (Mr. Reschenthaler), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n\tMs. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania?\n\tThere was no objection.\n\tMs. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Rules Committee met and reported a rule, House Resolution 147, providing for consideration of H.R. 5, the Equality Act, under a closed rule. The rule provides 90 minutes of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Committee on the Judiciary and one motion to recommit.\n\tThe rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 803, the Protecting America's Wilderness and Public Lands Act, under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Committee on Natural Resources and self-executes a manager's amendment from Chairman Grijalva. It also makes in order 29 amendments, provides en bloc authority to Chairman Grijalva, and provides one motion to recommit.\n\tMr. Speaker, we are here today to debate the rule for two critical pieces of legislation, H.R. 5, the Equality Act, and H.R. 803, the Protecting America's Wilderness and Public Lands Act.\n\tThis is a historic day for Congress and for equal rights. Over 45 years ago, Congresswoman Bella Abzug introduced the first version of the Equality Act, a bill that will provide full legal protections to LGBTQ people all across our country by extending the protections of the Civil Rights Act to them and making clear that we must respect, defend, and celebrate the dignity innate of everyone in our communities, including--and perhaps especially--those who are perceived as different or non-binary.\n\tThe version of the Equality Act that we consider today is the result of years of careful legislative drafting and amends existing civil rights laws to provide protection from discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in key areas of public life: employment, housing, credit, education, public spaces and services, federally funded programs, and jury service.\n\tAdditionally, the Equality Act updates the public spaces and services covered in current law to include retail stores and services, such as banks, legal services, and transportation. These important updates would strengthen existing protections for everyone.\n\tThe journey to this final version of the Equality Act was led by a dear colleague who is a historymaker in his own right, co-chair of the LGBTQ Equality Caucus and my colleague on the Judiciary Committee, Congressman   David Cicilline of Rhode Island. Congressman Cicilline worked with lawyers and advocates from the left and the right, religious groups, and a host of civil rights groups to make sure the language of the Equality Act achieved full legal equality while protecting existing civil rights for other marginalized groups.\n\tThe resulting bill is supported by 130 of the largest employees in the country, our largest labor unions, and the hundreds of organizations including, to name just a few, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the NAACP, the National Women's Law Center, the Episcopal Church, the Union for Reform Judaism, and the United Church of Christ.\n\tAnd, most importantly, it is supported by a clear and overwhelming majority of the American people. Seventy-one percent of Americans support this legislation, including majorities of Democrats, Independents, and Republicans.\n\tThe clear majority of both the House and the American people recognize that for too long LGBTQ people have faced discrimination with no Federal legal recourse. It is beyond dispute that LGBTQ people--especially transgender people and, even more so, transgender women of color--face discrimination across this country.\n\tTo echo other speakers, this issue is deeply personal for me. It has been personal since my baby sister came out to me almost 40 years ago. For many people all across this country and across this House, that is when this fight hits home.\n\tIt gets personal when someone whom you love says: This is who I am.\n\tIt gets personal when you know and value that person and you want to do whatever you can to make sure that your loved one can live their life to the fullest, free from hate and discrimination.\n\tI am sad to say that my home, Pennsylvania, is one of the 30 States that defies the will of its people by not having legal protections for LGBTQ people. The idea that my sister--someone who put her life on the line for our country when she served in our Armed Forces--could drive across State lines and lose protections is heartbreaking.\n\tThe Equality Act ends the patchwork of State laws and creates uniform, nationwide protections. LGBTQ people won't have to worry that being transferred to another State by their employer or needing to move home to take care of ailing parents will cause them to lose civil rights protections. From sea to shining sea, LGBTQ people will have the security and stability that comes from knowing that, if they face discrimination, they have legal recourse.\n\tIt is also important to note what the Equality Act does not do. The Equality Act does not impinge on religious freedom. Religious liberty is a cornerstone value of our Constitution and our country. Religious organizations are currently able to prefer their own members and their version of morality in hiring for religious positions, such as ministers and schoolteachers. The Equality Act does nothing to change that. The Equality Act does not force anyone to perform or obtain abortions in violation of their religious beliefs, and it does not strip girls of their title 9 protections.\n\tThe Equality Act does clarify what has long been held: That religious freedom laws do not create an exemption to civil rights laws.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n\tJust like a person can't use a claim of religious freedom to refuse to sell a house to an interracial couple, under the Equality Act LGBTQ families will be protected from discrimination regardless of its motivation.\n\tConsider the stakes facing LGBTQ people too often all across this country. A same-sex couple walks into a restaurant. Having hired a babysitter to look after their young children, they are hoping to have a relaxing night out. But, instead, when they are seated and looking at the menu, the manager comes over and tells them that they have to leave. They aren't welcome.\n\tThis kind of insecurity and humiliation occurs on a daily basis across this country, and in 30 States the couple would have no legal recourse. Often, humiliation is just the tip of the iceberg. Same-sex couples are far more likely to be denied housing; qualified and high-performing transgender people are more likely to be fired from their jobs; and LGBTQ young people face rejection and discrimination in school, which can deny them an education.\n\tThese injuries compound and lead to poverty, homelessness, and violence. The impact is felt the hardest by transgender women of color, who confront racial discrimination, sex discrimination, and gender identity discrimination. The intersection of these forms of discrimination is all too often deadly.\n\tThe protections provided by the Equality Act give LGBTQ people an equal chance at the American Dream. While discrimination and rejection has ended the lives of too many transgender people, many are succeeding despite discrimination.\n\tWe are talking here about the civil rights of our friends, our family, and public servants. In Pennsylvania, Dr. Rachel Levine, a transgender woman, served in the Governor's cabinet as Secretary for Health, and has recently been nominated by President Biden to serve as Assistant Health Secretary.\n\tMara Keisling, a Pennsylvania native, is the founder and Executive Director of the National Center for Transgender Equality and a pioneer for civil rights protections.\n\tSarah McBride was recently sworn in as the first transgender Senator in the State of Delaware.\n\tAnd of course, Pete Buttigieg was recently sworn in as the U.S. Secretary of Transportation, becoming the first openly gay cabinet member to be confirmed by the Senate.\n\tOpponents of the Equality Act keep trying to pit cisgender girls against transgender girls, when really this legislation is about strengthening opportunity for all girls and women. Whether it is women's sports, single-sex colleges, or homeless services for women, the Equality Act simply prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in these areas. It doesn't undermine these institutions or prohibit them; it simply ensures that they are inclusive of all women and girls, including trans women and girls.\n\tSupport for this legislation is overwhelming and deserves an overwhelmingly positive response from this body. I encourage all of my colleagues to support the rule and underlying legislation, and further encourage the Senate to swiftly act to pass this bill so that we can finally provide firm, statutory protections to the LGBTQ community.\n\tNext, Mr. Speaker, is H.R. 803, the Protecting America's Wilderness and Public Lands Act. This is a package of public bills from the Natural Resources Committee that will designate more than 1.5 million acres as wilderness areas, and more than 1,200 river miles into the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.\n\tThe bill would also withdraw more than 1.2 million acres of public land from new drilling and mining, ensuring that iconic landscapes like the Grand Canyon and Colorado's Thompson Divide are permanently protected for future generations to enjoy.\n\tFew things in the United States are as universally cherished by Americans as are our public lands. Our country is home to more than 111 million acres of designated wilderness, and these lands help us combat climate change, provide for an array of ecological diversity, and offer recreational activities to Americans young and old.\n\tAs we continue to endure the devastating effects of climate change, providing for millions of additional acres of wilderness will allow for these areas to continue to serve as critical ``carbon sinks'' to capture and mitigate carbon dioxide in our atmosphere.\n\tA similar version of this legislation passed the House last Congress, but this version includes a critical new piece from Natural Resources Committee Chairman Grijalva, the Grand Canyon Protection Act. This bill would permanently ban new mining claims on approximately one million acres of public land surrounding Grand Canyon National Park, while helping to protect the clean water resources critical to the livelihoods of local Tribal communities.\n\tThe Grand Canyon Protection Act was developed by Chairman Grijalva in close consultation with all of the relevant stakeholders in his district and serves to protect one of the most cherished places in the United States.\n\tYou may hear my colleague from Pennsylvania argue that this bill is nothing but a land grab, an attempt to subvert private industry. Of course, this couldn't be farther from the truth.\n\tMining, like every other industry, is subject to the whim of the free market. Historically, when the demand for these minerals has dropped, mining companies are all too prepared to skip town without cleaning up any of their mess.\n\tThis bill isn't about whether or not nuclear energy and its inputs will be part of our clean energy future, but if we want to ensure that it is, then I would recommend that we first start by supporting effective regulations on new and existing nuclear plants and their capabilities. The best way to ensure demand for a product is to similarly ensure that its user won't decide it isn't worth pursuing or is unaffordable.\n\tThe merits of nuclear energy aside, you can't deny that its use in this country is on the downswing or, at the very least, stagnant. This isn't due to over-regulation; it is due to under-regulation. It is due to massive cost overruns and incompetent government oversight.\n\tThe U.S. has had only one new nuclear reactor become operational in the last 20 years. This isn't because a mining company or two hasn't been afforded the opportunity to desecrate our national resources, but because the U.S. has not yet proven we can responsibly operate a nuclear plant that, from start to finish, is safe and has the trust of the American people.\n\tPublic lands do not belong to those only in the Congressional district in which they are located; they belong to all of us. Wilderness areas in the great State of Colorado belong to you and me as much as Independence Hall belongs to a native of Colorado. We all have a role to play in protecting these lands and seeking carveouts for mining companies is not the right way forward.\n\tI want to especially thank my colleague, Congresswoman Diana DeGette, for her tireless and bipartisan work in getting this legislation to such a great place.\n\tMr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\tMr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n\tI thank the distinguished gentlewoman from my home State of Pennsylvania for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.\n\tMr. Speaker, the rule before us provides for the consideration of two pieces of legislation. Let's just look at both pieces one at a time.\n\tThe first bill, H.R. 5, the Equality Act, provides for civil rights protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer individuals.\n\tLet me start by saying that Republicans believe all people should be treated equally under the law. Let me repeat that. Republicans believe all people should be treated equally under the law. But the Equality Act misses that mark.\n\tRather, H.R. 5 represents a radical departure from existing civil rights protections that will have significant implications on everyday life, and eliminate laws ensuring women and girls have the same opportunities as men and boys.\n\tJust take student athletics. H.R. 5 would redefine sex to include gender identity, meaning a transgender woman, a person who was born genetically male but identifies as a woman, could not be barred from participating in girls' or women's athletics.\n\tFurther, I have concerns that, due to the lack of committee action, this bill has not been fully thought out and it may be difficult, frankly, if not impossible, to actually implement in line with congressional intent.\n\tPerhaps the most pressing example of this is the term ``gender identity,'' which is so vague that even the special interest groups backing this bill cannot agree on a single definition of that.\n\tLastly, I am troubled that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act is not applicable under this measure. Without this vital protection, churches, synagogues, mosques, and religiously affiliated schools will be forced to act contrary to their deeply held beliefs or stop offering certain services to the public.\n\tReligious freedom was once an issue that all Americans, regardless of political party, strongly supported. It is incredibly disappointing to see my colleagues across the aisle abandon this principle in an effort to appease their far-left radical progressive base.\n\tMr. Speaker, the second part of this rule provides for consideration of H.R. 803, the Protecting America's Wilderness and Public Lands Act. This legislation consists of 8 natural resources bills, and will create nearly 1.5 million acres of wilderness, establish the most restrictive Federal land use classification, as well as lock up rivers and other lands across four western States.\n\tLike all my Republican colleagues, I strongly support responsible preservation of our Nation's natural resources. Remember, it was Republican Teddy Roosevelt who started this movement.\n\tHowever, my colleagues across the aisle have ignored this and have gone way too far. This bill takes a partisan approach to public land protection, and not a single Republican has cosponsored the underlying measures.\n\tFurther, some of the lands affected by this legislation lie in congressional districts where Members of Congress do not support such actions. These Members have not had the opportunity to share their opposition or their concerns, as bills in H.R. 803 were not marked up by this Congress. \n\tH.R. 803 also ignores input from local communities, who voiced concern that these measures will hurt local economies and rural jobs. As we recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, the last thing that we should be doing is eliminating good-paying, family-sustaining jobs.\n\tFurther, this bill will actually increase catastrophic wildfires, as the new wilderness and scenic river designations prohibit scientific forest management.\n\tI am especially concerned that this measure withdraws 1.2 million acres from mineral production, including uranium, a necessary component for the U.S. nuclear reactor fleet.\n\tCurrently, our Nation is relying on China for the vast majority of rare earth elements and critical materials, which are necessary for everything from building a fighter jet to a cell phone.\n\tJust last week, we saw China threaten to cut off its mineral supply to American defense contractors. We have watched as China has done this to sister democracies such as Japan.\n\tThis bill will give the Chinese Communist Party, and other unstable and hostile regimes, control over our energy and mineral needs, putting our economic and national security at risk.\n\tWe must not cut off access to the minerals and materials necessary for everyday life and for the protection of our Nation.\n\n\tI would urge my colleagues across the aisle to seek a bipartisan approach to these two bills, to this rule, not just today, but also in the weeks and months ahead.\n\tMr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the rule, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n\tMs. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), the distinguished chairman of the Rules Committee.\n\tMr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania, a distinguished member of the Rules Committee, for yielding me the time; and I want to thank her for her eloquent opening.\n\tMr. Speaker, we are just weeks away from the 53rd anniversary of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s famous speech at the National Cathedral. That is when he uttered the powerful line, ``The moral arc of the universe is long, but it bends towards justice.''\n\tIn many ways, those words are as misconstrued as they are well-known, because some have taken them to mean that if you just wait long enough, justice is inevitable. Dr. King knew better, though. He knew that for the moral arc to bend, people needed to be courageous enough to actually bend it.\n\tJust 6 years after this line was spoken, Members of this Chamber showed that courage when they introduced the original Equality Act. They did so in the shadow of the Stonewall riots, at a time when even discussing LGBTQ issues publicly was seen by many as taboo.\n\tThese Members recognized the fundamental unfairness in a patchwork of State laws being used to deny some Americans fundamental rights like jobs and homes, just because of who they were or who they loved.\n\n                              {time}  1400\n\n\tThey had the backbone to act, giving a voice in these hallowed Halls to the many advocates nationwide fighting for equality from the outside.\n\tGetting to this point has been a long, long, long road, and I am a proud cosponsor of the Equality Act that is before us today, and I have pushed for this day for a long time. I know this hasn't been easy. So many people and so many organizations, though, never wavered. And along the way, they changed hearts and minds on this issue.\n\tWhat may have been a radical idea then is not now. In fact, most people today not only support such protections for LGBTQ Americans, they incorrectly believe that they are already in place. That is how common sense this bill is, Mr. Speaker.\n\tThis House made history when it passed the Equality Act for the first time last Congress, and we did so in a bipartisan way. Unfortunately, it didn't even get a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate, and the prior Republican President didn't support it. But now we have new leadership in the Senate and a President who has made passing this bill a top priority.\n\tThis moment represents our best chance yet to finally make the Equality Act the law of the land. This moment, Mr. Speaker, is an opportunity to bend the moral arc toward justice, toward fairness, and toward equality, and I encourage all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to seize it.\n\tLet's support this rule and the underlying bill, and let's take a historic step forward toward building a more fair and just society for all Americans.\n\tMr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko), my good friend.\n\tMrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule.\n\tThe underlying legislation we are considering in this rule is wrought with concerning provisions. One underlying bill, H.R. 803, is just another land grab that will kill jobs, make our Nation hostage to hostile foreign powers, restrict public access and recreation opportunities on our public lands, and threaten our energy independence.\n\tSpecifically, in my home State of Arizona, this bill has dangerous implications for our mining industry. These provisions also threaten our national security by making the United States reliant on foreign nations for critical minerals.\n\tThe other bill in this rule, the so-called Equality Act, is anything but equal. In fact, it is a threat to women's privacy and safety. This bill effectively outlaws facilities reserved for biological females. This includes restrooms, showers, and locker rooms. And outrageously, this also includes women's domestic violence shelters.\n\tAs a survivor myself of domestic violence, I know the importance of these women's shelters. They are critical for women who are trying to escape domestic violence and sometimes sexual assault. Under this Equality Act, a man, a biological man, identifying as a woman cannot legally be turned away from any of these facilities.\n\tWomen will lose all rights to bodily privacy, safety, and security. Vulnerable women across America deserve better, Mr. Speaker.\n\tIn addition, this bill will end girls sports as we know it by mandating schools accept males into girls sports.\n\tI stand in opposition to both of the underlying bills, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this rule.\n\tMs. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I would just note for the record that over 20 States already have versions of this law, the Equality Act, with respect to participation in sports, as do the Olympics, and we have not seen the kind of behavior that has just been suggested.\n\tMr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).\n\tMr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman's courtesy and her careful, thoughtful explanation of what we are doing.\n\tI strongly support the Equality Act, extending civil rights protections to all citizens. I have been honored to be a part of this process throughout my political career, dating back as a child legislator in the 1970s in county government, in city government in Oregon, and for the last 25 years here in Congress.\n\tThe arguments that we are hearing have been heard before. The same sort of hysterical concerns have proven not to be the case. Wild claims have been proven wrong; and especially I think of marriage equality as the most compelling. Each reform, each step of the way, has been for progress, and equality was positive, and ultimately supported by the public, as is the Equality Act. The wild claims have been proven groundless.\n\tAt the end of the day, one of the reasons is that Americans are biased in favor of fairness and equality. Another important reason, as alluded to by my friend from Pennsylvania, is personal experience. There was fear and misapprehension, but as people became experienced with a family member who married, a transgender child, when you deal with the reality of real people, what we find is that they are people like everybody else, and we do not want their lives to be turned upside down.\n\n\tI come from a State where by and large these protections are in place, but they aren't in place for everybody everywhere, and we have an opportunity to make additional progress. One of the reasons that we have seen this progress take place is the advocacy of those in the LGBT community who have been tireless, thoughtful, articulate, strategic, moving the agenda forward and bringing along often reluctant politicians.\n\tLast but not least, I would reference what happened with our young people. Young people understand this. Young people are not hysterical. Young people express their concern and willingness to embrace others, regardless of sexual orientation, and that is why ultimately this cause will win. It is why so much progress has been made and why it will ultimately be successful.\n\tI deeply appreciate this being brought before us, an opportunity for us to approve the Equality Act, affirm the bedrock principle of full equality, move it on to the Senate, and hopefully now with an administration committed to equality, we can enact it into law for the benefit of citizens all across the country.\n\tI just have one 30-second evaluation of the notion of scientific forest management.\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Cuellar). The time of the gentleman has expired.\n\tMs. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from Oregon.\n\tMr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I will just say, I come from an area where so-called ``scientific management'' of forests has resulted in more forest fires, problems with water quality, problems with habitat. We are learning that we need to make different changes, and one of the tools that we have is extending wilderness protection. It strengthens the environment, protects wildlife, water resources, and makes them more resilient, not less.\n\tIt is not a matter of raking the forests, as Donald Trump said, but having an opportunity to allow the healing power of nature to provide those protections.\n\tMr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Good).\n\tMr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, in their continued relentless assault on religious freedoms, Democrats are trying today, with this terrible bill, to make wholesale and damaging changes to our Nation's civil rights laws with little to no debate or even discussion on how this legislation will affect the daily lives of Americans and the institutions we hold dear.\n\tWhile the Equality Act purports to be an inclusive piece of legislation, it is actually exclusive of those with a different viewpoint. It would ultimately put civil rights laws at odds with longstanding religious beliefs pertaining to sex, sexuality, and other moral issues.\n\tThe result would be that faith-based nonprofits, such as a Christian shelter for women or an adoption agency or other religiously affiliated providers of social services, could not minister in good conscience without suffering consequences under Federal law.\n\tWe have past history as a precedent, an ominous precedent, as we saw the Obama-Biden administration seek to close down the Little Sisters of the Poor and Catholic nuns who care for the dying simply because they would not pay for their employees' contraception or drugs inducing abortion.\n\tA vote for the Equality Act would solidify the Biden-Harris administration's efforts to enforce the same radical religious and moral litmus tests that leave no room for faith-based ministries and organizations to operate without subscribing to the dogma of the left.\n\tThe Equality Act essentially weaponizes civil rights laws against Americans' fundamental liberties, and we must reject this assault on our most precious of freedoms. I oppose this rule, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n\tMs. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I would just restate that this act does not take away any of the religious freedoms that are already enshrined in multiple laws. It does not change those laws.\n\tMr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\tMr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. Greene).\n\tMrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, in the spirit of the debate here for the rule, there seems to be quite a disagreement between each side over what exactly this bill says, so for a parliamentary question, I would like to request that the entire bill be read.\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman's request will not be entertained.\n\tMrs. GREENE of Georgia. Well, then, let's read some of the rules. You keep saying it doesn't violate religious freedoms when, in fact, it does. It says so directly here in the bill in these sections, and it is a shame that we aren't reading the exact text because it is the text that matters. It doesn't matter what you have to say or what I have to say. It is the actual wording.\n\tIn section 1107, it actually talks about: ``The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 shall not provide a claim concerning, or a defense to a claim under, a covered title, or provide a basis for challenging the application or enforcement of a covered title.''\n\tThis bill, in the text, also specifically talks about: ``With respect to gender identity, an individual shall not be denied access to a shared facility, including a restroom, a locker room, and a dressing room, that is in accordance with the individual's gender identity.''\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n\tMr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the gentlewoman from Georgia just to close.\n\n\tMrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, in the wording in the text of the bill of the Equality Act, it also says: ``With respect to sex, pregnancy, childbirth or a related medical condition shall not receive less favorable treatment than other physical conditions.''\n\tAs a parliamentary question, what does that mean? Does that mean that anyone can demand an abortion? And it is discrimination to be refused this medical service?\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has again expired.\n\tMs. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, with respect to the gentlewoman's question, with respect to the language in question, it has long been held by our courts that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act does not apply to civil rights laws.\n\tThe Equality Act looks to treat discrimination against LGBTQ individuals the same way as other forms of discrimination, including racial discrimination. So, these arguments just don't hold water.\n\tMr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\tMr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from the great State of Texas (Mr. Pfluger).\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n\tMr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to both bills. However, I am here to talk about the partisan Federal land grab package.\n\tLast week, my home State of Texas endured a harrowing winter storm that wiped out electricity and water for millions of Texans. It devastated homes and businesses and caused irreparable damage to livestock, crops, and industry production across the State. Tragically, some even lost their lives.\n\tOur State was under an extreme emergency. Living through that underscored the need for safe, affordable, reliable energy. We absolutely must have a reliable baseload for our energy grids and a level playing field for all forms of energy. The Federal Government cannot pick favorites in energy.\n\tWhat happened in Texas should shake our country into the realization that, as our population grows and our energy needs expand, any move to limit production will have dire consequences on our safety and our national security.\n\tUnfortunately, this bill is another step in the vendetta to limit the American energy production. The partisan $1.2 million Federal land grab----\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n\tMr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n\tMr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, the land grab is another Democrat attempt to restrict our country's abundant natural resources under onerous regulations that will kill jobs in the energy industry and put Americans at risk.\n\tThis is a matter of national security, and I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill and to vote for the safety and energy independence that this country so deserves. Please join me in voting ``no'' for both bills and both rules.\n\tMs. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I would just note that what we saw in Texas this past week was a truly astonishing, unusual snowstorm with frigid cold conditions that are not normal--as the Speaker knows--in Texas, and that happens because of climate change.\n\tBecause we haven't done enough to protect our wilderness and to protect our environment, we end up with extreme climate events like we just saw, and this bill is a step toward redressing that imbalance.\n\tMr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\tMr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n\tMr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to immediately consider H.R. 682, the Reopen Schools Act.\n\tI will do this to ensure that the $54.3 billion that Congress appropriated just last month to help schools reopen is, in fact, prioritized to meet the expenses of actually being able to open up schools for in-person learning.\n\tMr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record the text of my amendment, along with any extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania?\n\tThere was no objection.\n\tMr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. Hinson), who will explain the amendment.\n\tMrs. HINSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n\tMr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose the previous question. This is the third time here today that Republicans have called on this body to consider my bill, the Reopen Schools Act. It is a commonsense solution to get students and teachers to return to the classroom and to do it safely.\n\tThis legislation would condition a portion of State COVID relief grants for education on schools actually reopening. My Democrat colleagues already voted for these funds to be used specifically for schools to reopen safely back in December, $54 billion.\n\tThe science on this is definitive. If certain safety precautions are taken, teachers and students can resume in-person learning safely. So that is why Congress sent the States this money back in December.\n\tBut after nearly a year of this pandemic lockdown, millions of students are still learning exclusively from behind a screen. Our children are struggling academically and they are falling behind.\n\tBut the toll on mental health is what is most concerning to me. Even after a year, many kids haven't seen their school friends. They haven't been out to play on a playground. They are isolated, disconnected, and they are lonely. From increased stress and anxiety, depression, even suicidal thoughts or attempts, our youngest generation is facing a mental health crisis.\n\tHospitals have seen a staggering increase in mental health emergencies among young children. It is heartbreaking. And the longer the goal posts continue to be moved on reopening schools, the worse this mental health crisis for our young people will become.\n\tMy home State of Iowa is leading the way to put students' education and mental health first. My two sons got on the school bus this morning in Iowa. They are in class right now receiving hands-on attention from their teachers, and they will play with their friends at recess today.\n\tAs a parent, I am grateful that I had the ability to make the right choice for my children and send them back to class to learn in person. But millions of parents around the country have not been given this choice, with many school districts still only offering virtual learning. I have heard of so many families who are struggling as schools remain shuttered and they have no clear timetable for reopening.\n\tIt is vulnerable families with at-risk children who are impacted the most by these decisions. Let's think about the kids who don't have access to a computer or WiFi to try to complete their lessons online. Or let's talk about the kids who rely on school breakfast and lunch and they are going hungry without these vital nutrition programs. Or what about the victims of child abuse and neglect who are locked in with potential abusers. Or kids who are left at home all day because their parents have no choice but to go to work.\n\n\tWe cannot allow children and families to continue to suffer right now. It is time for students to get back into the classroom, and we can do it safely. With the Reopen Schools Act, they will be able to do so safely. Teachers will be back in the classroom safely, and we can get this country moving forward again.\n\tMr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me in supporting our students by defeating the previous question. We need to get kids back to school. So I urge a ``no'' vote.\n\tMs. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern).\n\tMr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n\tI have some good news for the gentlewoman who just spoke. The reconciliation bill that is coming to the floor, hopefully, on Friday will have a whole bunch of resources in it to help States safely reopen schools. So I hope we will get a good bipartisan vote on that.\n\tMr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Wenstrup), the good doctor.\n\tMr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the previous question. If the previous question is defeated, Republicans will amend this rule to immediately consider H.R. 682, the Reopen Schools Act, which I am proud to cosponsor.\n\tAs a father of two small children, their overall health and well-being is my top priority; not just my children, but all of America's children. And as I have looked around this Chamber, I see lots of Members on both sides of the aisle who I know to be great parents and grandparents, and I know they want the best for their children, too.\n\tI am also a doctor, and I am co-chair of our Doctors Caucus. Throughout this pandemic, we have heard calls from Members, and now from President Joe Biden, that we need to trust the science.\n\tAs a doctor, I wholeheartedly agree--and the science is clear--students and teachers can go back to in-person learning safely. I know this because my own children have been fortunate enough to go back to school in person all of this school year safely.\n\tThe American Academy of Pediatrics has stressed the importance of students returning to school for their overall health and well-being, and the CDC research is clear that transmission in schools is extremely low.\n\tLast week, I joined Congresswoman Hinson, Whip Scalise, and Ranking Member Foxx on a call with parents from all across the country who want their children to be able to go back to school. It was a bipartisan event. To them, this wasn't a partisan issue. The parents on the call were from across the entire political spectrum: Republicans, Democrats, and Independents.\n\tWe heard heartbreaking stories from them about some of their children falling into depression, losing their reading comprehension, and struggling to focus.\n\tKids are attempting or committing suicide at an alarming rate. In one county in Nevada, the suicide rate doubled from the previous year. Hospitals across the country are seeing unprecedented increases in children suicide attempts and mental health admissions.\n\tYes, there is some risk to returning, but nothing in life is zero risk. The consequences of staying closed are far too grave and our children are suffering both socially and academically because of it.\n\tMr. Speaker, I rise today to support the Reopen Schools Act because we have given schools the funding needed to reopen safely. However, some schools, seemingly under pressure from powerful teachers' unions, refuse to return to in-person learning.\n\tCongress has provided more than $54 billion in State COVID relief grants for education to help reopen schools. We didn't, however, require the schools to actually reopen if they were to access the money, and that was a mistake.\n\tCongresswoman Hinson's bill will address that issue by conditioning those funds on States producing a reopening plan to get students back to school as quickly as possible. \n\tThere are at least 3 months left in most school years around the country. We can't just let schools put off returning to in-person learning until next fall or later. We need to do what is best for our students, our children, our grandchildren, our nieces and nephews. We need to reopen the schools now.\n\tWe can't, for example, expect sixth-grade teachers to teach fourth graders.\n\tMr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to defeat the previous question. I thank Congresswoman Hinson for her leadership on this bill.\n\tMs. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n\tI would just note, as a parent, a former school board member, and education advocate, of course, we all want what is best for our students and what is best for our schools.\n\tBut I would also suggest that a one-size-fits-all, everybody has to go back in person to schools does not serve anybody well.\n\tWe have seen around the country--first of all, our schools in Pennsylvania are not closed. They are open. Some are virtual, some are hybrid, some are in person. But each community is doing what it needs to do in response to the conditions that are present at this time.\n\tSo I agree with my colleague on the Rules Committee that we absolutely need to get our school districts and our State and local governments the money they need to safely reopen schools, and we are looking forward to doing that with our reconciliation bill on Friday.\n\tMr. Speaker, I just inquire whether the gentleman from Pennsylvania is prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.\n\tMr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I have no further speakers and at this time, and I am prepared to close.\n\n\tMr. Speaker, Republicans believe everyone should be treated equally under the law. But H.R. 5 is a radical approach that will have serious, unintended consequences for female athletes, victims of sexual violence, houses of worship, and healthcare professionals. The list goes on and on. Critically, the bill undermines important religious freedom protections.\n\tAs for H.R. 803, let's call this what it is. It is a land grab. This is a land grab, which will kill jobs in rural communities. It will leave us vulnerable to hostile nations for our energy and mineral needs. It will restrict access and recreation opportunities for the American public.\n\tFor all these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question and ``no'' on the underlying measure.\n\tMr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\tMs. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n\tMr. Speaker, today, we are moving forward on two pieces of legislation whose timely consideration is long overdue. And I would note that H.R. 5 did pass last Congress with a bipartisan majority.\n\tSo we are looking forward, at long last, to passing the Equality Act through both Chambers and removing the burden of discrimination that can move us closer to a country where members of the LGBTQ community have an equal opportunity to achieve the American Dream.\n\tThe Equality Act isn't going to be the end of our long journey toward full LGBTQ equality, but it will bring our laws into line across the country with values that our country was founded upon.\n\tWe must continually take steps to make our country more perfect. Acknowledging in law the challenges that actually face LGBTQ people and taking concrete action to correct them brings us another step closer.\n\tMr. Speaker, we will pass the Protecting America's Wilderness and Public Lands Act in order to ensure that the sacred lands that all Americans share equally cannot be tarnished for the benefit of a few.\n\tWe have a long way to go in addressing the myriad problems facing this country, but the two bills before us today are a strong and necessary start to helping our Nation live up to its full potential.\n\tMr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous question.\n\tThe material previously referred to by Mr. Reschenthaler is as follows:\n\n                   Amendment to House Resolution 147\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following:\n       Sec. 6. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the \n     House shall resolve into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     682) to encourage local educational agencies to resume in-\n     person instruction at elementary and secondary schools, and \n     for other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be \n     dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of \n     the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the \n     bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and \n     controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the \n     Committee on Education and Labor. After general debate the \n     bill shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute \n     rule. All points of order against provisions in the bill are \n     waived. When the committee rises and reports the bill back to \n     the House with a recommendation that the bill do pass, the \n     previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill \n     and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening \n     motion except one motion to recommit. If the Committee of the \n     Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution on \n     the bill, then on the next legislative day the House shall, \n     immediately after the third daily order of business under \n     clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole \n     for further consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 7. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 682.\n\n\tMs. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question.\n\tThe question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it.\n\tMr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore.

In accordance with this provision, I have \nsent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice \nstating that the national emergency with respect to Cuba that was \ndeclared on March 1, 1996, in Proclamation 6867, as amended by \nProclamation 7757 on February 26, 2004, Proclamation 9398 on February \n24, 2016, and Proclamation 9699 on February 22, 2018, is to continue in \neffect beyond March 1, 2021.\n  There remains a need to continue this national emergency, based on a \ndisturbance or threatened disturbance of the international relations \nfor the United States related to Cuba. The unauthorized entry of any \nUnited States-registered vessel into Cuban territorial waters continues \nto be detrimental to the foreign policy of the United States.\n  The unauthorized entry of vessels subject to the jurisdiction of the \nUnited States into Cuban territorial waters is currently a violation of \nFederal law. Further, the unauthorized entry of United States-\nregistered vessels into Cuban territorial waters continues to be \ndetrimental to United States foreign policy and counter to the purpose \nof Executive Order 12807, which is to ensure, among other things, safe, \norderly, and legal migration. The possibility of large-scale \nunauthorized entries of United States-registered vessels into Cuban \nterritorial waters would disturb the international relations of the \nUnited States regarding Cuba by allowing for or providing the means to \nfacilitate a mass migration of Cuban nationals and threatening our \nnational security.\n  Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the \nnational emergency with respect to Cuba and the emergency authority \nrelating to the regulation of the anchorage and movement of vessels set \nout in Proclamation 6867, as amended by Proclamation 7757, Proclamation \n9398, and Proclamation 9699.\n                                                     Joseph R.

In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice stating that the national emergency with respect to Cuba that was declared on March 1, 1996, in Proclamation 6867, as amended by Proclamation 7757 on February 26, 2004, Proclamation 9398 on February 24, 2016, and Proclamation 9699 on February 22, 2018, is to continue in effect beyond March 1, 2021.\n\tThere remains a need to continue this national emergency, based on a disturbance or threatened disturbance of the international relations for the United States related to Cuba. The unauthorized entry of any United States-registered vessel into Cuban territorial waters continues to be detrimental to the foreign policy of the United States.\n\tThe unauthorized entry of vessels subject to the jurisdiction of the United States into Cuban territorial waters is currently a violation of Federal law. Further, the unauthorized entry of United States-registered vessels into Cuban territorial waters continues to be detrimental to United States foreign policy and counter to the purpose of Executive Order 12807, which is to ensure, among other things, safe, orderly, and legal migration. The possibility of large-scale unauthorized entries of United States-registered vessels into Cuban territorial waters would disturb the international relations of the United States regarding Cuba by allowing for or providing the means to facilitate a mass migration of Cuban nationals and threatening our national security.\n\tTherefore, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency with respect to Cuba and the emergency authority relating to the regulation of the anchorage and movement of vessels set out in Proclamation 6867, as amended by Proclamation 7757, Proclamation 9398, and Proclamation 9699.\n                                                     Joseph R.

Mr. President, I am going to talk for just a few minutes \nabout the need to open our schools. I think you would agree with me \nbecause I followed your career--with admiration, by the way--that our \ncountry is only as good as its dreams and we are only as valuable as \nour children. And, in my judgment, we are doing immeasurable damage in \nthis country to our children.\n  We all know that we had to close down our public schools and our \nparochial schools and our private schools, pre-K to 12, because of the \ncoronavirus, but I think most fairminded Americans understand that we \nneed to open them.\n  The future of this country is education. It is not the level of the \nstock market. It is not the unemployment rate. It is not who the \nPresident is. It is education, and we know that. So why aren't we \nopening our public schools when we know it is safe to do so?\n  I am very proud of our efforts in Louisiana. Seventy percent of our \npublic school students are back learning in person--70 percent. And I \nwant to thank every teacher, every parent, every school board member, \nevery maintenance worker in our schools, and anyone who directly or \nindirectly influenced this result. They are heroes in my opinion. \nSeventy percent--I am so proud of that.\n  I especially want to thank our teachers. I have been a volunteer \npublic school teacher in Louisiana for--I don't know--20-plus years. I \ndo it three times a year, and I am a real substitute--none of this go \nfor an hour and talk about how a bill becomes a law. I am a real \nsubstitute: quarter to 7 to 3, teach five classes, do your bus duty, \nyour lunchroom duty, and get worn out. So I have some appreciation for \nwhat it takes to teach, particularly in this difficult environment, and \nI especially want to thank our teachers.\n  But that 70 percent figure that I am talking about, the number of our \npublic school children in Louisiana who are back to in-person learning, \nis only 40 percent nationwide, and that is an embarrassment. That is a \ndisgrace. We are doing immeasurable damage--immeasurable damage--to a \ngeneration of children.\n  Now, I don't need to tell you we have been struggling with elementary \nand secondary education for the last 40 or 50 years, and it is very \nfrustrating because Americans can do extraordinary things. We can \nunravel the human genome. Americans can take a diseased human heart and \nreplace it with a new\n\n[[Page S834]]\n\none and make it beat. Americans can send a person to the moon and bring \nhim back or her back. But we struggle to teach our kids how to read and \nwrite and understand the meaning of their diplomas when we have 18 \nyears to do it.\n  Now, there are a lot of reasons for that, and I am sure not blaming \nanybody, and I don't want to digress. But my point is, we were \nstruggling before the coronavirus. That should tell us that now more \nthan ever, given our circumstances before the coronavirus, we need to \ntake meaningful steps to get these schools back open.\n\n  We know that it is safe. The CDC Director under President Trump has \nsaid it was safe. The CDC Director under President Biden has said it is \nsafe.\n  Vaccination across America is--we started out a little rocky, a lot \nlike our testing program, but it is getting much better.\n  I read an article the other day in the Wall Street Journal, written \nby a Johns Hopkins researcher, physician, who said, in his opinion, \nabout six or seven times more Americans have had the coronavirus than \nwe know of; therefore, they do have immunity. And he said, coupled with \nthe number of people who have had and survived coronavirus and our \nvaccine program, which is getting more aggressive every day, we could \nhave a substantial reduction in the number of coronavirus cases by \nMarch and April. Indeed, we have seen the decline in the number of our \ncases now, today, starting from early January. They have declined \ndramatically. And people smarter than me have suggested it is our \nvaccines, it is the approach to herd immunity, and, of course, it is \nthe habits that we have developed in terms of social distancing and \nmasking and good hygiene.\n  But my point is that the experts, the science, all tell us that it is \nsafe. And I have to tell you, I don't mean to be unfair because I know \nit is complicated, or it can be, and I don't mean disrespect, but I \nhave been very, very disappointed with President Biden. He has flipped \nand flopped on this issue like a banked catfish. He has said we need to \nfollow science, but he refuses to follow the science in terms of \nopening our schools.\n  We know it can be done because we have been doing it in Louisiana. We \nhave done it. If you look nationwide at the number of private schools \nthat are open, back with in-person education, the number of parochial \nschools, the number of Catholic schools--they are doing it. Why can't \nwe do it in our public schools?\n  It is not money. For our first five coronavirus bills--I am not \ncounting President Biden's proposed bill. Through our first five \ncoronavirus bills, we have appropriated between $70 billion and $80 \nbillion to our public schools to get them back open. Our public schools \nhave spent $5 billion out of 70 to 80--I think it is $70 billion. So it \nis not a matter of money. I think it is just--I am not sure what it is. \nI don't want to be a cynic and say that it is a matter of will. But \nhere is what I am asking President Biden to do; here is what I would do \nif I were King for a day. I am not; I don't aspire to be. But here is \nwhat I am hoping that President Biden will do this afternoon: Call a \npress conference, and look the American people in the eyes, and look \nour school board members in the eyes and our teachers and our parents \nand our maintenance workers and say that we need to open up.\n  If we really believe we are only as good as our dreams, we are only \nas valuable as our children, then we need to act like it. And I think \nPresident Biden needs to call that press conference. He doesn't need to \ntalk about the science, though that is important, or the politics or \nnibble around the edges. He needs to look the American people in the \neye and say: By God, open the schools. Open the schools. Our kids \ndeserve no less.\n  There is not much I agree with former Congressman and Mayor Rahm \nEmanuel on, even though I think he is a bright guy, but politically we \napproach the world differently. But he said when he was mayor that kids \ndrop out--not in the 12th grade. They drop out in pre-K and \nkindergarten and the first, second, third, and the fourth grades. We \nare going to lose a whole generation of kids here.\n  I see I have some additional time while we are waiting on Senator \nSchumer. I think I am going to take my additional time--and I will cut \nit short if Senator Schumer is here--to talk about another issue\n\n", "cleaned_text": "Schools\n\n\tMr. KENNEDY.

We know that in February, the Russian Government sentenced \nAlexei Navalny, a very prominent opposition leader to Mr. Putin, to \nalmost 3 years in prison. And shortly afterward, Mr. Putin directed \nthat thousands of Mr. Navalny's supporters who were protesting be \narrested.\n  What was he--what were his supporters--arrested for? Criticizing Mr. \nPutin. Navalny's imprisonment comes in the wake of his near-fatal \npoisoning, about which we have all read. And what happened to Mr. \nNavalny should be a wake-up call to our friends in Europe. It is \ncertainly a wake-up call to the American people.\n  This isn't the first time that Mr. Putin has tried to get rid of a \ndissident. Unfortunately, it probably won't be the last. For years, \nRussia has been making trouble, both at home and abroad. Mr. Putin has \nmade trouble here in America, about which we all know. Domestically, \nopponents of Mr. Putin have been arrested. They have died in prison. In \nsome cases, they have been murdered. We all know that.\n  Now, if this is how Mr. Putin is going to treat his own people, \nimagine how he would and has treated foreign countries, particularly \nour friends in Europe. Russia has launched an unjustified invasion of \nGeorgia. It still controls large parts of Georgian territory. In 2014, \nMr. Putin invaded Ukraine. He illegally annexed the Crimea. He started \na war in Eastern Ukraine. It cost about 14,000 lives.\n  But Russia's aggression--Mr. Putin's aggression--and let me say, I am \nnot impugning the people of Russia. They are wonderful people. I admire \nthem deeply. But their leadership, their political leadership, is \nlacking. And Mr. Putin's aggression begs the question: If NATO troops \ndid not stand in the way, what else would Russia do? Who knows what \nwould happen to Poland and the Baltic States and other countries that \nwere once part of the Soviet sphere.\n  The Economist puts it this way--I am going to quote:\n\n       Russia's gangsterism has become impossible to ignore.\n       Russia's gangsterism has become impossible to ignore.\n\n  But our friends in Europe seem to be doing a pretty good job of it.\n  The Navalny case shows that criticizing the Kremlin comes with a \ncost, but it is a cost that we and the European Union can and must bear \nbecause the price of appeasement is too high. And our European friends \ncan do it, taken as a group. Senator Schumer knows this. The EU's power \nsurpasses Russia's by far. The EU is a bloc of 450 million people. Its \nGDP is nine times larger than Russia's.\n  Russia's economy is only slightly bigger than Spain's, and it is \nsmaller than the economy of Italy. A lot of people don't realize this, \nbut Russia--look, I will concede them this: They have nuclear weapons \nand good spies. But the economy of Russia is smaller than the economy \nof New York State. So why is Europe so content to be bullied?\n  I am going to give you a quick case in point. Josep Borrell visited \nRussia following Navalny's imprisonment. Mr. Borrell is the EU's top \nforeign affairs official. He allowed--stood there and allowed--Russian \nForeign Minister Lavrov--I know Mr. Lavrov. Perhaps you have met him, \nMr. President. I understand his personality. He doesn't exhaust himself \ntrying to win friends. But Mr. Borrell, representing the EU, its top \nforeign official in foreign affairs, stood there and allowed Foreign \nMinister Lavrov to push him around shamelessly. The Russian Foreign \nMinister insulted the EU. He called it an unreliable partner while \nBorrell stood there and said nothing--nothing.\n  Another example, Germany. Germany is still supporting construction of \nthe Nord Stream 2 Pipeline, a project that is going to leave Europe \neven more reliant on Russian oil and gas.

We know that in February, the Russian Government sentenced Alexei Navalny, a very prominent opposition leader to Mr. Putin, to almost 3 years in prison. And shortly afterward, Mr. Putin directed that thousands of Mr. Navalny's supporters who were protesting be arrested.\n\tWhat was he--what were his supporters--arrested for? Criticizing Mr. Putin. Navalny's imprisonment comes in the wake of his near-fatal poisoning, about which we have all read. And what happened to Mr. Navalny should be a wake-up call to our friends in Europe. It is certainly a wake-up call to the American people.\n\tThis isn't the first time that Mr. Putin has tried to get rid of a dissident. Unfortunately, it probably won't be the last. For years, Russia has been making trouble, both at home and abroad. Mr. Putin has made trouble here in America, about which we all know. Domestically, opponents of Mr. Putin have been arrested. They have died in prison. In some cases, they have been murdered. We all know that.\n\tNow, if this is how Mr. Putin is going to treat his own people, imagine how he would and has treated foreign countries, particularly our friends in Europe. Russia has launched an unjustified invasion of Georgia. It still controls large parts of Georgian territory. In 2014, Mr. Putin invaded Ukraine. He illegally annexed the Crimea. He started a war in Eastern Ukraine. It cost about 14,000 lives.\n\tBut Russia's aggression--Mr. Putin's aggression--and let me say, I am not impugning the people of Russia. They are wonderful people. I admire them deeply. But their leadership, their political leadership, is lacking. And Mr. Putin's aggression begs the question: If NATO troops did not stand in the way, what else would Russia do? Who knows what would happen to Poland and the Baltic States and other countries that were once part of the Soviet sphere.\n\tThe Economist puts it this way--I am going to quote:\n\n       Russia's gangsterism has become impossible to ignore.\n       Russia's gangsterism has become impossible to ignore.\n\n\tBut our friends in Europe seem to be doing a pretty good job of it.\n\tThe Navalny case shows that criticizing the Kremlin comes with a cost, but it is a cost that we and the European Union can and must bear because the price of appeasement is too high. And our European friends can do it, taken as a group. Senator Schumer knows this. The EU's power surpasses Russia's by far. The EU is a bloc of 450 million people. Its GDP is nine times larger than Russia's.\n\tRussia's economy is only slightly bigger than Spain's, and it is smaller than the economy of Italy. A lot of people don't realize this, but Russia--look, I will concede them this: They have nuclear weapons and good spies. But the economy of Russia is smaller than the economy of New York State. So why is Europe so content to be bullied?\n\tI am going to give you a quick case in point. Josep Borrell visited Russia following Navalny's imprisonment. Mr. Borrell is the EU's top foreign affairs official. He allowed--stood there and allowed--Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov--I know Mr. Lavrov. Perhaps you have met him, Mr. President. I understand his personality. He doesn't exhaust himself trying to win friends. But Mr. Borrell, representing the EU, its top foreign official in foreign affairs, stood there and allowed Foreign Minister Lavrov to push him around shamelessly. The Russian Foreign Minister insulted the EU. He called it an unreliable partner while Borrell stood there and said nothing--nothing.\n\tAnother example, Germany. Germany is still supporting construction of the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline, a project that is going to leave Europe even more reliant on Russian oil and gas. We are going backward here. This is going to make the EU even more vulnerable to Russian influence because we know that a more independent Europe becomes--the more Europe becomes dependent on Russian energy, the more reluctant it will be to defend itself against its neighbor's bullying. \n\tI don't want to beat this point to death. America is ready to do its part. We have imposed sanctions on Mr. Putin. I support President Biden's attempt to engage our friends in Europe and our effort to try to convince China to become a stable part of world order, but we shouldn't forget to do the same thing with respect to Mr. Putin.

The country has just suffered \nfrom a once-in-a-century event that shuttered thousands of businesses, \nsapped more than 10 million jobs, and, according to CBO, left a $17 \ntrillion hole in our economy.\n  As the distribution of the vaccine finally begins to accelerate under \nthe Biden administration, there is certainly hope on the horizon. But \nwe are a far way off from a full recovery, and it is our job--our job--\nto help millions of Americans--struggling Americans--through the next \nseveral months of difficulty and hasten the day when our country can \nfinally return to normal.\n  The American Rescue Plan is designed to do just that--keep American \nfamilies and businesses and schools and workers afloat until they can \nget back on their feet. And there is a broad consensus that our country \nneeds more support to get through this crisis. Mayors and Governors \nfrom both parties support the plan. The Republican Governor of West \nVirginia told Congress: ``[W]e need to go big.''\n  Economists from across the political spectrum say that our economy \nneeds further support. The Chair of the Federal Reserve, appointed by \nPresident Trump, just told us that ``the economic recovery remains \nuneven and far from complete, and the path ahead is highly uncertain.'' \nChairman Powell, hardly a raving liberal, concluded: ``There is a long \nway to go.''\n  And it has broad support in America. Seven in 10 Americans approve of \nthe American Rescue Plan. In some polls I have seen, a majority of \nRepublicans approve of this plan--Republican voters, not Republicans \nhere in the Senate.\n  Now, it is easy to see why there is such broad support. The COVID \npandemic is the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, the \nworst public health crisis our Nation has faced in 100 years. But our \nRepublican colleagues say all these groups demanding the $1.9 trillion \nAmerican Rescue Plan--business leaders, government officials from both \nparties, economists from across the spectrum, and 7 in 10 Americans--\nRepublicans say all of them are wrong.\n  According to a report in CNN, Republican leaders are maneuvering to \nget every single Republican Member to oppose the emerging legislation--\nevery single one.\n  Make no mistake, Republicans oppose the American Rescue Plan to the \ndetriment of the country, and they do so at their own political peril. \nIf our Republican colleagues want to oppose direct checks to struggling \nfamilies; food assistance to hungry Americans; keeping teachers, \nfirefighters, and essential public employees on the job; providing \nanother round of support for small business; helping schools reopen as \nquickly and safely as possible; speeding vaccinations around the \ncountry--well, if congressional Republicans want to oppose all that, my \nresponse is, good luck.\n  The country needs this final push. It is overwhelmingly popular. A \nnew analysis this morning showed another vaccine produced by a U.S. \ncompany is safe and effective, which only underscores the need for \nFederal dollars to accelerate its distribution. It will help millions \nof American families survive the ongoing crisis, recuperate from the \neconomic hardship of the past year, and set our country on a firm path \nto recovery.\n  That is why Senate Democrats have made it the first legislative item \non our agenda. By stark contrast, the first action item taken by the \nRepublican Senate majority when they got the majority in 2017 was an \nattempt to repeal our Nation's healthcare law and rip health coverage \naway from millions of Americans.

Mr. President, yesterday, I discussed the K-12 crisis \nfacing American families. The science shows that in-person schooling \ncan easily be made safe. Private and religious schools and schools in \nEurope have been open for months.\n  But Washington Democrats have apparently bought into Big Labor's myth \nthat schools cannot reopen without even more Federal funding, even \nthough their own plan would only spend about 5 percent--5 percent of \nthe money this fiscal year.\n  This is just one illustration of how Democrats started with \npreconceived ideological goals and actually worked backward, instead of \nstarting with the actual needs of American families.\n  Let's take a look at the economy. When we had to stall our economy to \nprotect our health system, the Senate wrote the bipartisan CARES Act, \nthe biggest rescue package in American history. It spent $2.2 trillion \nto save the healthcare system, find vaccines, and support families. We \nrefilled many of those programs with another $920 billion just last \nDecember.\n  Today, we stand at a very different kind of crossroads. More than 13 \npercent of Americans have received at least one dose of the vaccine. \nManufacturers expect vaccine supply to keep ramping up dramatically in \nthe weeks ahead.\n  The trillions we spent on rescue policies in 2020 had the economy \nprepped to come roaring back as health conditions keep improving.\n  Unemployment today is already lower than where, at one point in this \ncrisis, the Federal Reserve predicted it would be by the end of the \nyear. In some blue-collar sectors, both total employment and job \nopenings are already higher than they were before the pandemic. Retail \nsales just smashed experts' predictions. Many manufacturers can't keep \npace with demand.\n  Remarkably, even as economic output obviously shrunk in 2020, overall \nhousehold personal income and personal savings actually went up. That \nis because of the relief Congress delivered.\n  There is no question that some American families are still \nstruggling. Nobody thinks our health or economic fight is finished yet, \nbut on a broad national scale, households are sitting on an historic \npile of pent-up cash, waiting for the economy to reopen.\n\n  The former head of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers \nsays:\n\n       We have no historic parallel with anything like this level \n     of excess saving.\n\n  He says we have never seen this much ``dry powder.''\n  Even mainstream liberal economists agree that our country does not \nneed another massive fire hose of borrowed money. This is not April of \n2020. This is a different chapter.

Mr. President, yesterday, I discussed the K-12 crisis facing American families. The science shows that in-person schooling can easily be made safe. Private and religious schools and schools in Europe have been open for months.\n\tBut Washington Democrats have apparently bought into Big Labor's myth that schools cannot reopen without even more Federal funding, even though their own plan would only spend about 5 percent--5 percent of the money this fiscal year.\n\tThis is just one illustration of how Democrats started with preconceived ideological goals and actually worked backward, instead of starting with the actual needs of American families.\n\tLet's take a look at the economy. When we had to stall our economy to protect our health system, the Senate wrote the bipartisan CARES Act, the biggest rescue package in American history. It spent $2.2 trillion to save the healthcare system, find vaccines, and support families. We refilled many of those programs with another $920 billion just last December.\n\tToday, we stand at a very different kind of crossroads. More than 13 percent of Americans have received at least one dose of the vaccine. Manufacturers expect vaccine supply to keep ramping up dramatically in the weeks ahead.\n\tThe trillions we spent on rescue policies in 2020 had the economy prepped to come roaring back as health conditions keep improving.\n\tUnemployment today is already lower than where, at one point in this crisis, the Federal Reserve predicted it would be by the end of the year. In some blue-collar sectors, both total employment and job openings are already higher than they were before the pandemic. Retail sales just smashed experts' predictions. Many manufacturers can't keep pace with demand.\n\tRemarkably, even as economic output obviously shrunk in 2020, overall household personal income and personal savings actually went up. That is because of the relief Congress delivered.\n\tThere is no question that some American families are still struggling. Nobody thinks our health or economic fight is finished yet, but on a broad national scale, households are sitting on an historic pile of pent-up cash, waiting for the economy to reopen.\n\n\tThe former head of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers says:\n\n       We have no historic parallel with anything like this level \n     of excess saving.\n\n\tHe says we have never seen this much ``dry powder.''\n\tEven mainstream liberal economists agree that our country does not need another massive fire hose of borrowed money. This is not April of 2020. This is a different chapter. Washington should focus on practical policies to finish this fight: accelerate vaccinations; get kids back in school; help the families and small businesses that actually need help; and get laid-off Americans matched with job openings ASAP.\n\tUnfortunately, the Democrats' partisan proposal would not just be wasteful but, in certain ways, actually counterproductive. It would have Washington go out of its way to discourage hiring, discourage a return to work, and actually keep things shut down longer.\n\tTake the minimum wage policy.

Even in the middle of last year, it was questionable policy to pay people more to stay home than essential workers were earning while actually on the job. Now another long-term, flat supplement would make even less sense.\n\tHere is how one leading economist puts it:\n\n       In an expanding economy that is putting the virus behind \n     it, paying people more in unemployment than they could \n     receive from working is an act of substantial economic self-\n     harm.

Mr. President, last week, I was home, as most Members of \nthe Senate were, but I was asked to participate in a Zoom call with two \npeople I highly respect, Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Collins, with the \nNational Institutes of Health. While sitting at my dining room table in \nSpringfield, IL, there were about a dozen Senators who had access to \nZoom to be a part of that conversation. I felt like I was privileged to \nreally hear some information which most Americans wanted to hear, and I \nknew it had to be important for them to ask for a briefing in the \nmiddle of the week.\n  What they were talking about during the course of that hour were \nvariants, what is happening to this coronavirus as it replicates over \nand over and over again millions of times. What they told us--and I am \na liberal arts lawyer, so I don't profess any sort of medical expertise \nhere--was that there were dominant variants that were starting to \nemerge, and they told us the shorthand description that they used in \nthe laboratories.\n  I just remember that the first one was the UK, United Kingdom, \nvariant. They said, by the end of March, which is not that far away--4 \nweeks plus--it will be the dominant strain of coronavirus in the United \nStates. I was taken aback by that to think that a variant could become \nthat dominant that quickly, but it was fair warning that it was about \nto occur. Then they talked about the South African variant, which is \njust starting to appear.\n  The good news is they have done enough testing to believe that both \nof the major vaccines we are now using across America, which are \nModerna and Pfizer--I have Pfizer, and my wife has Moderna--are \neffective against the UK, United Kingdom, variant. The jury is still \nout when it comes to the South African variant. There is a third \nvariant, and I won't venture into trying to remember exactly what that \nwas about, but I remember it had some origin in South America.\n  I heard that news, and I thought to myself, this is an ongoing \nbattle. We haven't run up any kind of score against this coronavirus. \nWe can't sit back and relax. We are in a very busy third quarter in \ntrying to vaccinate America and in watching for each and every new \nthreat.\n  So, in that circumstance, if you were the President of the United \nStates, what would you do?\n  Well, Joe Biden, President Joe Biden, decided that we needed to be \naggressive, that we needed to face reality, not only with regard to the \nhalf a million Americans who have died but that we need to put together \nthe tools to fight this coronavirus as we know it and as it is likely \nto evolve. He needs an army to do that. It is that big a war. He came \nto us with a proposal to start that effort, in a substantial way, under \nhis leadership. He calls it the American Rescue Plan. I hear my \ncolleagues come to the floor and really raise the question as to \nwhether this is needed, and I just heard the speech of the minority \nleader, Senator McConnell.\n  What President Biden wants to do to deal with this pandemic, as we \nknow it and as it is likely to evolve, is to provide $20 billion more \nfor our vaccination program. Does anyone doubt the need for that? I \ndon't. I think it is the key to getting America back to business.\n  He provides $50 billion for testing, lab capacity improvements, and \ngenomic sequencing of this virus mutation. Again, I am not an expert in \nscience, but it seems perfectly reasonable to me, after listening to \nDrs. Fauci and Collins, to make that investment right now.\n  President Biden wants to invest in 100,000 community health workers \nto help with the vaccinations and contact tracing--100,000. It seems \nlike a lot, but in a nation of 350 million, I am not sure it is that \noverwhelming a number. He wants to fund the community health centers so \nthat they will be able to tackle this issue and particularly address \nthe issue of health disparities;\n\n[[Page S838]]\n\nuse the Defense Production Act to provide $10 billion for America's \nmanufacturer of the key equipment we need to fight this pandemic and \nthe next one, God forbid, whenever it may be; and to expand healthcare \ncoverage for Americans in this time of pandemic by subsidizing COBRA \ncoverage. What does it mean? If you had health insurance with your job \nand you lost your job and you lost your health insurance, we allow \npeople to buy that health insurance that the employer offered, but they \nhave to pay for the whole ride, both the employer's and employee's \nsides of it, and it turns out to be prohibitive. It doesn't work unless \nwe give a subsidy for that coverage to be extended into your \nunemployment situation.\n  And then $4 billion, which sounds small when we are talking \ntrillions, but $4 billion for community health--pardon me--behavioral \nhealth and addiction services and counseling services.\n  I learned the hard way over that break as well that we are ignoring \nthe opiate crisis in America, but it is not ignoring us. It is \ndramatically increasing, primarily because we are not devoting the \nresources to it. And the mental health situation of many Americans is \naggravated by isolation and social distancing, and addiction is even \nworse.\n  So I have just described for you the health side of President Biden's \nAmerican Rescue Plan. I would like to hear any of my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle argue with me--I am ready to take them on--that \nthat is not needed. Of course it is needed. It is needed now, and it \nneeds to be an investment we make because if we don't break the back of \nthis pandemic, we are not going to get this economy reopen again, we \nare not going to get our kids back in school, we are not going to get \nto see our grandkids the way we want to, our children or grandkids, and \nwe are not going to see America return to what we all desperately want \nit to return to.\n  The reason I raise that this morning is when I heard the Senator from \nKentucky raising skeptical observations about this plan, I thought \nback. It was a year ago on the floor of the Senate--nothing short of a \npolitical miracle--that the first CARES Act, under President Donald \nTrump, the first CARES Act passed this Senate with an overwhelming vote \nof 96 to nothing. That doesn't happen much around here, even for \nresolutions on motherhood. But 96 to nothing--bipartisan support for \nthe relief bill proposed by President Trump and the Congress in March \nof last year. It was a good feeling, and we knew we had to do it. We \nwere in it together, and we knew we had a challenge.\n  Then came last December, just a few weeks back, and again under the \nTrump administration a proposal for a $900 billion relief bill for \nCOVID-19. It passed the Senate with 92 votes, 92 out of 100 Senators. \nIt just showed the bipartisanship that we mustered, thank goodness, \nwhen we needed it because the Nation needed it, and we did it \ntogether--96 in March, 92 Senators in December. We stood behind that \nplan even though it had the blessing of a President of a different \nparty at a controversial moment in history. We stood behind it because \nthe American people needed it.\n  Now comes President Joe Biden, 5 or 6 weeks into his Presidency, and \nsays: Let me take my leadership opportunity and responsibility \nseriously, and let me come with a $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan. \nWhere is the bipartisanship that we saw last year?\n  I do want to dispute the conclusion of Senator McConnell when it \ncomes to the state of the economy. I did take a few economics courses. \nI don't profess to be an expert. Let's listen to someone who is: \nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, testifying on Capitol Hill. \nWhat did he have to say? Well, he told us that we are in a situation \nthat is far from over. We have an economy that is still challenging.\n  Here are some things that were left out of the rosy analysis by the \nSenator from Kentucky:\n  ``There are still 10 million more unemployed people than before the \npandemic began.'' Ten million unemployed American workers. ``While many \nparts of the economy have recovered,'' Chairman Powell said, ``the \nunemployment rate for the lowest-paid quarter of the labor force is \nprobably above 20 percent.'' Above 20 percent. ``There's a long way to \ngo,'' Chairman Powell said.\n  Economic activity rebounded in the summer after much of the economy \nreopened from spring shutdowns. But that momentum ``slowed \nsubstantially,'' in the words of Chairman Powell, with sectors that \nrely on person-to-person contact, like hospitality and entertainment, \nenduring the worst blows. ``That burden has also largely fallen on low-\nwage workers, Black and Hispanic Americans, and other minority \ngroups,'' Powell said.\n  I don't believe we are out of the woods yet. I believe we have got a \nlong way to go. The American people believe that too.\n  President Biden believes it, and when he starts talking about getting \nus back on our feet, he is suggesting extending unemployment insurance \nprograms that expire in just 2 weeks. On March 14, unemployment \nprograms will start to expire, and he wants us to move quickly to make \nsure that doesn't happen.\n  I support that effort for two reasons. First, it is humane. We are \ntalking about fellow Americans out of work through no choice of their \nown. Secondly, putting money into unemployment benefits for unemployed \nworkers is the single best investment when it comes to revitalizing the \neconomy. They do not turn to the Wall Street Journal when they receive \nthose checks; they turn to the mailbox and try to figure out how they \nare going to pay the rent and pay for the food on the table. They spend \nthe money. That is what unemployment is all about.\n  So to have the other side question President Biden's proposal to give \nunemployment benefits beyond March 14 really says that they are turning \ntheir backs on millions of Americans who have no place else to go.\n  Oh, there is a fear on the other side that we just may be paying \npeople too much. You know, if you give them a little too much money on \nunemployment, they just might sit home and binge on Netflix and \nchocolate-covered cherries. Well, I suppose that is always going to \nhappen no matter how you write the laws, but I think a lot more of \nAmerican workers. I believe they want to get back to work anywhere near \nthe salaries that they left behind. I think they are desperately \nlooking for those opportunities, and we ought to help them in the \nmeantime keep their families together.\n  Emergency paid leave is still an absolute necessity in light of this \ncoronavirus and the way it deals with us.\n  I want to also make a plea here for the minimum wage, and I know \nthere is some controversy associated with it.\n\n  Mr. President, glad to have you. You are new to the Senate.\n  Back at that desk there, a fellow named Ted Kennedy used to stand. I \nused to love to come to the floor when Senator Ted Kennedy of \nMassachusetts would give his speeches. When he got into it, he was \namazing. His booming voice could be heard all over the Senate Chamber, \nand I never heard him more energized than when he argued for increasing \nthe minimum wage.\n  Oftentimes he was a lonely voice--there were no proposals before us \nand none likely to appear--but he never failed to come to this floor \nand remind us on a regular basis of how we had failed year after year \nafter year to increase the minimum wage.\n  He would tell the story of people in America getting up and going to \nwork every single day, sometimes two jobs a day, to try to keep their \nfamilies together and still qualifying for food stamps and assistance \nfrom our government. He would ask us when we were going to give them \nthe dignity of passing an increase in the minimum wage.\n  I can still hear him thundering across the Chamber. I wouldn't want \nto be in the place of arguing a different position than the one he held \nbecause he took it over. I don't have that skill; I wish I did. I am \nglad to have seen him use that skill so effectively to help people who \nwere just doing their best to get by and struggling.\n  How many times do all of us give speeches about inequality in America \nand why we have to do better for the working people? We do it all the \ntime, and everybody knows it is a fact. Wages in America, salaries have \nnot kept up. People at the top have done quite well, thank you, but \nthose at the bottom have struggled to get by.\n  Try to make it on $7.25 an hour. I was trying to do a calculation \nearlier on\n\n[[Page S839]]\n\njust what that is. Is that $15,000 a year? Is that $1,200 a month? Is \nthat $300 a week? Could you make it on $300 a week? I am talking about \neverything, now. I am talking about rent and mortgage and car payment, \nfood, utilities--the basics. I couldn't. I don't know how anyone can, \nand most can't. They fall deeply into debt and into despair.\n  So when President Biden talks about us reopening the conversation \nabout our Federal minimum wage, it is long overdue--long overdue--and \nit is an easier issue for me than some because our Governor, J. B. \nPritzker, when he took over the State of Illinois, set us on course to \nreach $15 an hour as a State over the same period of time that Joe \nBiden has suggested, by 2025.\n  I just want to say that those people who are really struggling with \nthe notion of increasing the minimum wage in all fairness really ought \nto think about the people out there who are struggling to get by week \nto week and month to month.\n  There is another proposal that is in this bill that is currently \nbeing debated, and it is the $1,400 addition to the cash payment for \nmany families. I put it in the same category in order to restore equity \nand opportunity to a lot of people who otherwise wouldn't have it. This \nis the second installment. The first was $600 in the bill we passed \nlast December. This $1,400 payment will help many families.\n  I want to add one element that was debated a few weeks ago. Senator \nTodd Young of Indiana, whom I respect and is a friend, had offered an \namendment at what was known as a vote-arama as to who would receive \nthis $600 payment. I think the payment amount has been increased in the \nlatest Biden proposal.\n  But the point I tried to make and I think he and I agree on, although \nI won't speak for him, is that if a child legally in America, a citizen \nof this country, with a Social Security number, lives in a household \nwith parents who are undocumented--they may be working and paying taxes \nwith something called an ITIN--but that child should not be \ndiscriminated against or at a disadvantage because of the parents' \nimmigration status. If the children qualify, the children should be \nreceiving those payments. I believe the House reconciliation bill does \nthat, and I hope that any measure that we consider will do the same.\n  So let me close. I see the Senator on the floor asking for an \nopportunity to speak.\n  Yes, I support the American Rescue Plan. Is it possible that I would \nhave written it differently? Yes. Are there provisions I would change? \nYes. But I want to tell you, when we passed the CARES Act measure last \nDecember, that was true as well.\n  We are in a time of a national challenge and a national crisis. We \nhave a President who is facing it squarely, taking it on, accepting \nresponsibility, and asking for our help. Can we do anything less?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n\n", "cleaned_text": "Coronavirus\n\n\tMr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last week, I was home, as most Members of the Senate were, but I was asked to participate in a Zoom call with two people I highly respect, Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Collins, with the National Institutes of Health. While sitting at my dining room table in Springfield, IL, there were about a dozen Senators who had access to Zoom to be a part of that conversation. I felt like I was privileged to really hear some information which most Americans wanted to hear, and I knew it had to be important for them to ask for a briefing in the middle of the week.\n\tWhat they were talking about during the course of that hour were variants, what is happening to this coronavirus as it replicates over and over and over again millions of times. What they told us--and I am a liberal arts lawyer, so I don't profess any sort of medical expertise here--was that there were dominant variants that were starting to emerge, and they told us the shorthand description that they used in the laboratories.\n\tI just remember that the first one was the UK, United Kingdom, variant. They said, by the end of March, which is not that far away--4 weeks plus--it will be the dominant strain of coronavirus in the United States. I was taken aback by that to think that a variant could become that dominant that quickly, but it was fair warning that it was about to occur. Then they talked about the South African variant, which is just starting to appear.\n\tThe good news is they have done enough testing to believe that both of the major vaccines we are now using across America, which are Moderna and Pfizer--I have Pfizer, and my wife has Moderna--are effective against the UK, United Kingdom, variant. The jury is still out when it comes to the South African variant. There is a third variant, and I won't venture into trying to remember exactly what that was about, but I remember it had some origin in South America.\n\tI heard that news, and I thought to myself, this is an ongoing battle. We haven't run up any kind of score against this coronavirus. We can't sit back and relax. We are in a very busy third quarter in trying to vaccinate America and in watching for each and every new threat.\n\tSo, in that circumstance, if you were the President of the United States, what would you do?\n\tWell, Joe Biden, President Joe Biden, decided that we needed to be aggressive, that we needed to face reality, not only with regard to the half a million Americans who have died but that we need to put together the tools to fight this coronavirus as we know it and as it is likely to evolve. He needs an army to do that. It is that big a war. He came to us with a proposal to start that effort, in a substantial way, under his leadership. He calls it the American Rescue Plan. I hear my colleagues come to the floor and really raise the question as to whether this is needed, and I just heard the speech of the minority leader, Senator McConnell.\n\tWhat President Biden wants to do to deal with this pandemic, as we know it and as it is likely to evolve, is to provide $20 billion more for our vaccination program. Does anyone doubt the need for that? I don't. I think it is the key to getting America back to business.\n\tHe provides $50 billion for testing, lab capacity improvements, and genomic sequencing of this virus mutation. Again, I am not an expert in science, but it seems perfectly reasonable to me, after listening to Drs. Fauci and Collins, to make that investment right now.\n\tPresident Biden wants to invest in 100,000 community health workers to help with the vaccinations and contact tracing--100,000. It seems like a lot, but in a nation of 350 million, I am not sure it is that overwhelming a number. He wants to fund the community health centers so that they will be able to tackle this issue and particularly address the issue of health disparities; use the Defense Production Act to provide $10 billion for America's manufacturer of the key equipment we need to fight this pandemic and the next one, God forbid, whenever it may be; and to expand healthcare coverage for Americans in this time of pandemic by subsidizing COBRA coverage. What does it mean? If you had health insurance with your job and you lost your job and you lost your health insurance, we allow people to buy that health insurance that the employer offered, but they have to pay for the whole ride, both the employer's and employee's sides of it, and it turns out to be prohibitive. It doesn't work unless we give a subsidy for that coverage to be extended into your unemployment situation.\n\tAnd then $4 billion, which sounds small when we are talking trillions, but $4 billion for community health--pardon me--behavioral health and addiction services and counseling services.\n\tI learned the hard way over that break as well that we are ignoring the opiate crisis in America, but it is not ignoring us. It is dramatically increasing, primarily because we are not devoting the resources to it. And the mental health situation of many Americans is aggravated by isolation and social distancing, and addiction is even worse.\n\tSo I have just described for you the health side of President Biden's American Rescue Plan. I would like to hear any of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle argue with me--I am ready to take them on--that that is not needed. Of course it is needed. It is needed now, and it needs to be an investment we make because if we don't break the back of this pandemic, we are not going to get this economy reopen again, we are not going to get our kids back in school, we are not going to get to see our grandkids the way we want to, our children or grandkids, and we are not going to see America return to what we all desperately want it to return to.\n\tThe reason I raise that this morning is when I heard the Senator from Kentucky raising skeptical observations about this plan, I thought back. It was a year ago on the floor of the Senate--nothing short of a political miracle--that the first CARES Act, under President Donald Trump, the first CARES Act passed this Senate with an overwhelming vote of 96 to nothing. That doesn't happen much around here, even for resolutions on motherhood. But 96 to nothing--bipartisan support for the relief bill proposed by President Trump and the Congress in March of last year. It was a good feeling, and we knew we had to do it. We were in it together, and we knew we had a challenge.\n\tThen came last December, just a few weeks back, and again under the Trump administration a proposal for a $900 billion relief bill for COVID-19. It passed the Senate with 92 votes, 92 out of 100 Senators. It just showed the bipartisanship that we mustered, thank goodness, when we needed it because the Nation needed it, and we did it together--96 in March, 92 Senators in December. We stood behind that plan even though it had the blessing of a President of a different party at a controversial moment in history. We stood behind it because the American people needed it.\n\tNow comes President Joe Biden, 5 or 6 weeks into his Presidency, and says: Let me take my leadership opportunity and responsibility seriously, and let me come with a $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan. Where is the bipartisanship that we saw last year?\n\tI do want to dispute the conclusion of Senator McConnell when it comes to the state of the economy. I did take a few economics courses. I don't profess to be an expert. Let's listen to someone who is: Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, testifying on Capitol Hill. What did he have to say? Well, he told us that we are in a situation that is far from over. We have an economy that is still challenging.\n\tHere are some things that were left out of the rosy analysis by the Senator from Kentucky:\n  ``There are still 10 million more unemployed people than before the pandemic began.'' Ten million unemployed American workers. ``While many parts of the economy have recovered,'' Chairman Powell said, ``the unemployment rate for the lowest-paid quarter of the labor force is probably above 20 percent.'' Above 20 percent. ``There's a long way to go,'' Chairman Powell said.\n\tEconomic activity rebounded in the summer after much of the economy reopened from spring shutdowns. But that momentum ``slowed substantially,'' in the words of Chairman Powell, with sectors that rely on person-to-person contact, like hospitality and entertainment, enduring the worst blows. ``That burden has also largely fallen on low-wage workers, Black and Hispanic Americans, and other minority groups,'' Powell said.\n\tI don't believe we are out of the woods yet. I believe we have got a long way to go. The American people believe that too.\n\tPresident Biden believes it, and when he starts talking about getting us back on our feet, he is suggesting extending unemployment insurance programs that expire in just 2 weeks. On March 14, unemployment programs will start to expire, and he wants us to move quickly to make sure that doesn't happen.\n\tI support that effort for two reasons. First, it is humane. We are talking about fellow Americans out of work through no choice of their own. Secondly, putting money into unemployment benefits for unemployed workers is the single best investment when it comes to revitalizing the economy. They do not turn to the Wall Street Journal when they receive those checks; they turn to the mailbox and try to figure out how they are going to pay the rent and pay for the food on the table. They spend the money. That is what unemployment is all about.\n\tSo to have the other side question President Biden's proposal to give unemployment benefits beyond March 14 really says that they are turning their backs on millions of Americans who have no place else to go.\n\tOh, there is a fear on the other side that we just may be paying people too much. You know, if you give them a little too much money on unemployment, they just might sit home and binge on Netflix and chocolate-covered cherries. Well, I suppose that is always going to happen no matter how you write the laws, but I think a lot more of American workers. I believe they want to get back to work anywhere near the salaries that they left behind. I think they are desperately looking for those opportunities, and we ought to help them in the meantime keep their families together.\n\tEmergency paid leave is still an absolute necessity in light of this coronavirus and the way it deals with us.\n\tI want to also make a plea here for the minimum wage, and I know there is some controversy associated with it.\n\n\tMr. President, glad to have you. You are new to the Senate.\n\tBack at that desk there, a fellow named Ted Kennedy used to stand. I used to love to come to the floor when Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts would give his speeches. When he got into it, he was amazing. His booming voice could be heard all over the Senate Chamber, and I never heard him more energized than when he argued for increasing the minimum wage.\n\tOftentimes he was a lonely voice--there were no proposals before us and none likely to appear--but he never failed to come to this floor and remind us on a regular basis of how we had failed year after year after year to increase the minimum wage.\n\tHe would tell the story of people in America getting up and going to work every single day, sometimes two jobs a day, to try to keep their families together and still qualifying for food stamps and assistance from our government. He would ask us when we were going to give them the dignity of passing an increase in the minimum wage.\n\tI can still hear him thundering across the Chamber. I wouldn't want to be in the place of arguing a different position than the one he held because he took it over. I don't have that skill; I wish I did. I am glad to have seen him use that skill so effectively to help people who were just doing their best to get by and struggling.\n\tHow many times do all of us give speeches about inequality in America and why we have to do better for the working people? We do it all the time, and everybody knows it is a fact. Wages in America, salaries have not kept up. People at the top have done quite well, thank you, but those at the bottom have struggled to get by.\n\tTry to make it on $7.25 an hour. I was trying to do a calculation earlier on just what that is. Is that $15,000 a year? Is that $1,200 a month? Is that $300 a week? Could you make it on $300 a week? I am talking about everything, now. I am talking about rent and mortgage and car payment, food, utilities--the basics. I couldn't. I don't know how anyone can, and most can't. They fall deeply into debt and into despair.\n\tSo when President Biden talks about us reopening the conversation about our Federal minimum wage, it is long overdue--long overdue--and it is an easier issue for me than some because our Governor, J. B. Pritzker, when he took over the State of Illinois, set us on course to reach $15 an hour as a State over the same period of time that Joe Biden has suggested, by 2025.\n\tI just want to say that those people who are really struggling with the notion of increasing the minimum wage in all fairness really ought to think about the people out there who are struggling to get by week to week and month to month.\n\tThere is another proposal that is in this bill that is currently being debated, and it is the $1,400 addition to the cash payment for many families. I put it in the same category in order to restore equity and opportunity to a lot of people who otherwise wouldn't have it. This is the second installment. The first was $600 in the bill we passed last December. This $1,400 payment will help many families.\n\tI want to add one element that was debated a few weeks ago. Senator Todd Young of Indiana, whom I respect and is a friend, had offered an amendment at what was known as a vote-arama as to who would receive this $600 payment. I think the payment amount has been increased in the latest Biden proposal.\n\tBut the point I tried to make and I think he and I agree on, although I won't speak for him, is that if a child legally in America, a citizen of this country, with a Social Security number, lives in a household with parents who are undocumented--they may be working and paying taxes with something called an ITIN--but that child should not be discriminated against or at a disadvantage because of the parents' immigration status. If the children qualify, the children should be receiving those payments. I believe the House reconciliation bill does that, and I hope that any measure that we consider will do the same.\n\tSo let me close. I see the Senator on the floor asking for an opportunity to speak.\n\tYes, I support the American Rescue Plan. Is it possible that I would have written it differently? Yes. Are there provisions I would change? Yes. But I want to tell you, when we passed the CARES Act measure last December, that was true as well.\n\tWe are in a time of a national challenge and a national crisis. We have a President who is facing it squarely, taking it on, accepting responsibility, and asking for our help. Can we do anything less?\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, earlier this month, 16 Democratic Senators \nintroduced a resolution calling for President Biden to forgive $50,000 \nof Federal student loan debt per borrower--$50,000.\n  There is no question that student loan debt is a problem for many \nAmericans. College costs have risen to unrealistically high levels, and \nmany students or their parents take out unrealistic amounts of debt in \nresponse. But the answer to this problem is not to have the President \nor Congress simply step in and forgive a large chunk of student loan \ndebt.\n  To start with, Democrats' plan is incredibly, fundamentally unfair. \nRight now, there are individuals around this country who have just paid \noff the last of their student loans. They have been working hard, \nmaking payments, sometimes for a couple of years, sometimes for a \ncouple of decades, as was the case with me. What happens to these \nindividuals if the President steps in and forgives $50,000 of student \ndebt? Well, I will tell you what happens--nothing. These individuals \nwho have worked hard for years to pay off their debt will see no \nbenefit from the Democrats' blanket loan forgiveness. Meanwhile, other \nAmericans who have made no more than a month or two of payments will \nsee their student loans entirely disappear. That is incredibly unfair. \nIn addition to being unfair, forgiving student loan debt does \nabsolutely nothing to address the problems that created this debt \ncrisis in the first place. In fact, the Democrats' solution is likely \nto make things worse.\n\n  What possible incentive will students have to take the responsible \napproach to borrowing if they think the Federal Government will step in \nand solve their debt problem? What incentive will colleges have to \nrestrain tuition growth if they think they can rely on the Federal \nGovernment to subsidize their students' tuition fees through loan \nforgiveness?\n  Forgiving $50,000 in student loans would also set a terrible \nprecedent on the sanctity of contracts. While it may at times be ill-\nadvised, students freely enter into the agreements they make when they \ntake out a loan. Should we really be teaching that agreements and \ncontracts mean nothing, that people can incur debt and then not have to \npay it off? And about that ``not paying it off,'' the phrase ``student \nloan forgiveness'' carries with it a suggestion that these debts will \njust disappear, that $50,000 can be wiped off each American's slate and \nvanish into the ether.\n  But, of course, we know that is not the case either. This is money \nstudents have borrowed from the Federal Government, and if the \nGovernment doesn't get that money back, the Government will be facing \nan unexpected debt.\n  Now, some people, especially some Democrats, tend to talk as if the \nGovernment draws on an unlimited pot of money, but, of course, we know \nthat is not true. Government funds aren't anywhere close to being \nunlimited, and Government coffers are not filled from a pot of gold at \nthe end of the rainbow. They are filled by taxpayer dollars, and, \nsooner or later, it will be taxpayers who foot the bill for any loan \nforgiveness program, including the many taxpayers who opted not to \nattend college or chose a debt-free way of doing so. There are a lot of \nAmericans out there who saved up to get a degree or went part-time to \navoid incurring debt. Are they really supposed to foot the bill for \nother Americans' student loans?\n  While you might think that Democrats' plan is largely targeted to \nlow-income or disadvantaged individuals, that is not actually the case. \nUnder the Democrats' plan, an American making $20,000 and an American \nmaking $120,000 would receive the same loan relief. In fact, since more \nloan dollars are held by those in higher income brackets, higher income \nAmericans could end up benefiting the most. And that brings up another \nthing that we need to remember.\n  Yes, a number of Americans carry a significant amount of student loan \ndebt, but some of those Americans have incurred that debt for a career \nthat will bring significant financial rewards.\n  Plus, a substantial portion of student loan debt is not for \nundergraduate degrees but for graduate and professional degrees. Under \nthe Democrats' student loan forgiveness proposal, taxpayers could be \nsubsidizing not just bachelor's degrees but master's degrees and Ph.D. \ndegrees, as well as law and medical degrees.\n  Instead of putting taxpayers on the hook for billions, we should be \nfocused on exploring ways to drive down education costs and educate \nstudents on the dangers of taking on excessive debt.\n  We should also be highlighting affordable education options like our \nNation's community and technical colleges. These colleges, like the \noutstanding institutions we have in South Dakota, provide students with \nassociate's degrees, certificates, apprenticeships, opportunities to \nlearn a trade, and more.\n  There are also things we could do to help students pay off loans \nwithout putting taxpayers on the hook for such massive amounts of \nmoney. In December, Congress passed a 5-year legislation that I \nintroduced with Senator Warner to allow employers to help employees \nrepay their loans. Our Employer Participation and Repayment Act amends \nthe Educational Assistance Program to permit employers to make tax-free \npayments on their employees' student loans.\n  Previously, employers could make tax-free contributions to their \nemployees' tuition if their employees were currently taking classes, \nbut they\n\n[[Page S840]]\n\ncouldn't provide tax-free contributions to help employees with \neducation debts that they had already incurred. Our bill allows them to \nmake tax-free contributions to help with employees' already existing \nstudent loan debt. That is a win-win situation. It is a win for \nemployees who get help paying off their student loans, and it is a win \nfor employers who have a new option for attracting and retaining \ntalented workers.\n  Our bill is not a silver bullet, but it will certainly help ease the \npain of paying back student loans for a number of young Americans. I am \npleased it was enacted into law for a 5-year period, and I hope \nCongress will act to make it permanent.\n  Another big thing we could do is make sure that graduates have access \nto good-paying jobs. This is key to enabling people to pay off their \ndebt, and we should resolve to build on the economic progress that we \nhad made prepandemic and focus on policies that will allow our economy \nto grow and to thrive.\n  High college costs and student debt are a problem, but blanket loan \nforgiveness is not the answer. I hope that President Biden will resist \nDemocratic calls to put taxpayers on the hook for literally billions \nand billions of dollars in student loans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, in recent days the Biden administration \nhas backed away from its original goal to reopen most schools within \nthe first 100 days. This comes despite new Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention research recommending that schools can safely reopen for \nin-person instruction.\n  Arkansas schools reopened their doors in August of 2020. Currently, \nthe Arkansas Department of Education reports that 67 percent of K-12 \nstudents are attending school in-person full time, almost 13 percent \nhave a hybrid schedule, and 20 percent are entirely remote.\n  Natural State school districts invested in cleaning supplies, \nbarriers, and retrofitting classrooms. Educators thought creatively and \nfound solutions to these new problems. And although every school and \ncommunity has different challenges, they moved ahead with the same \ngoal: finding the best and the safest way to get and keep children and \nteachers in the classroom.\n  I had the opportunity to visit several school districts last fall. I \nwas so impressed with their daily efforts to keep their doors open, \nkeep their staff healthy, and provide the learning that children \ndesperately need.\n  These heroes need our support. Over the course of this past year, \nCongress has delivered $113 billion--and over $686 million to \nArkansas--to support education through the COVID-19 pandemic, including \nnearly $68 billion to help bring K-12 students back into the classroom. \nThat money is already hard at work. However, much of it remains to be \nspent.\n  Parents can see that virtual learning simply isn't working. If you \nneed more evidence of the unbalanced impact of 100-percent virtual \nlearning, a study by the RAND Corporation in fall 2020 highlighted \ntremendous areas of concern. Researchers surveyed educators across the \ncountry and concluded that State and Federal Governments needed to \nprioritize making schools safe to attend. One particularly shocking \nresult of the survey found that principals in America's highest poverty \nschools reported only 80 percent of their students had adequate \ninternet access at home. When schools are virtual, we are knowingly \nfailing 20 percent of those students without even getting to the \nquestion of how effective the instruction is or addressing the negative \neffects on students' social needs and development.\n  This crisis in education also means that families are falling behind. \nWomen, in particular, are shouldering an incredible burden through this \npandemic. In February 2020, women held the majority of nonfarm payroll \njobs. They outnumbered men in the workforce for the first time in \nAmerican history. Today, the number of women in the workforce is at a \n33-year low. Much of this is attributed to the outsized role women are \nplaying in balancing their families' financial, educational, and \ncaregiving needs.\n  Of all the challenges we have faced through the COVID-19 pandemic, \nthe mission of educating children continues to be one of the most \ncritical and complex. It has been rewarding to see educators receive \ntheir much needed COVID-19 vaccine. These heroes are essential to our \nrecovery.\n  Arkansas is setting the example. The Natural State can be proud of \nthe teachers, administrators, and elected leaders who continue to find \nways to keep schools open and provide critical services that children \ndeserve. It is time that students in other States have the same \nopportunities.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, a year ago, schools began to close due to \nthe coronavirus. Teachers quickly scrambled to try to figure out how \nthey were going to teach kids who weren't there. They set up virtual \nclassrooms on the internet. Parents started googling activities to keep \ntheir children motivated and active, but they didn't start that a year \nago. They started 11 months ago. It didn't take long to figure out that \nkids at home are different than kids at school. And even before that, \nmany parents had to start accommodating their schedule to try to figure \nout how they were going to deal with this new and unanticipated \nschedule.\n  Congress stepped up. On multiple occasions, we passed emergency \nlegislation to get money to schools to clean classrooms, to buy laptops \nfor students, and to do almost anything else that schools thought they \nmight need at the elementary and secondary level. But what started as \nwhat I believe everybody thought was a stopgap--certainly no longer \nthan until the weather got hot in the summertime as we finished up the \nlast school year--has become, in many places, permanent, full time now, \nwhere students for a year have not been in school. That is despite a \nlot of widespread consensus that both scientists and medical experts \nthink that kids can be back in the classroom.\n  The science on studying and learning is also clear that when schools \nare closed, students suffer. There have been a lot of studies to show \nthat prolonged remote learning puts kids at higher risk for falling \nbehind, for failing classes, for suffering from mental health problems, \nand, in many cases, just deciding not to show up. And, you know, the \none thing about virtual is it is pretty easy to not virtually be there \nas well.\n  The risks on all those areas--the mental health problems, the falling \nbehind, the failing grades--are even greater for students with \ndisabilities or for minorities or people who live in generally \nunderserved areas. A study by McKinsey looked at the toll prolonged \nremote learning has taken on students. It estimated that when it comes \nto mathematics, students, on average, are likely to lose 5 to 9 months \nof learning by the end of this school year. It said that students of \ncolor--this is according to McKinsey--could be 6 to 12 months behind at \nthe end of this school year. Think about that. One year of remote \nlearning could leave students 1 year behind where they should be in \nmath if you look at these expert studies.\n  In addition to the academic damage, remote learning has led to an \nincrease in mental health challenges facing students. A report by the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention found that mental health \nproblems accounted for a growing proportion of students' visits to \nhospital emergency rooms. Visits were up 31 percent for kids between \nages 12 and 17 and 24 percent for kids between ages 5 and 11, and \naccording to the CDC, many of those visits are based on a mental health \nchallenge rather\n\n[[Page S841]]\n\nthan some other kind of health challenge.\n  The risk of keeping kids at home are significant. What is worse, they \nare unnecessary by the growing number of people who are looking at \nthis. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, who is the head of CDC, recently appointed \nby President Biden--she began her work there on January 21--talked \nabout what we should do earlier this month. She said that there was \n``increasing data''--``increasing data that schools can safely \nreopen.'' That ends the quote, but she went on to say, even if teachers \naren't vaccinated for the virus.\n  Anthony Fauci--Dr. Fauci echoed that point. He said: ``I would back \nthe CDC recommendation because that is really based on data . . . we \nneed to try and get the children back to school.'' That ends Dr. \nFauci's quote. He went on a step further by saying that it is not even \nworkable to wait for every teacher to be vaccinated before schools \nreopen because, when you think about that, if every teacher had their \nfirst vaccine today in the double-vaccine world we are still in, it \nwill be the end of March before every teacher had their second vaccine, \nand you are so far down the line, before you know it, the school might \nnot be able to reopen in that circumstance.\n  Dr. David Rosen, a professor of pediatric infectious diseases at \nWashington University in St. Louis, said:\n\n       There is no situation in which schools can't be open unless \n     they have evidence of in-school transmission.\n\n  The Biden White House actually immediately said they just didn't \nagree with the experts on this, even the ones in their own \nadministration. The President's Press Secretary said that Dr. Walensky \nwas speaking in her personal capacity when she said that you can go \nback to school even if teachers weren't vaccinated, even though she was \nspeaking in an official White House coronavirus briefing. Now, how the \nhead of the CDC speaks in her personal capacity at an official White \nHouse coronavirus briefing on this topic, I don't know, but that is \nwhat happened\n  The White House just keeps repeating these points that teachers \nshould be a priority for vaccination. I don't have a problem with that. \nI think that would be a great thing. It would make teachers more \ncomfortable and might make parents more comfortable. In fact, when we \nwere debating the budget resolution just a couple of weeks ago, I \noffered an amendment that would have incentivized school districts to \nget kids back to school after teachers had been vaccinated. That is \nmore stringent than the President himself has said and more stringent \nthan the CDC has said, but my amendment was blocked on a party-line \nvote. Every single Member of our friends on the other side voted \nagainst an amendment that would say we should incentivize, financially, \ngetting kids back to school when teachers have been vaccinated.\n  Now, a couple of my friends on the other side walked up and said: \nWell, we just need to work this language a little bit because all of us \nthat have kids know how important it is that we get our kids back to \nschool. Democrats say we need emergency legislation to help the \nschools. I have been part of five bills that did that, and we provided \n$67.5 billion for K-12 schools to reopen safely. So far, States have \nspent just under $7 billion of that $67 billion, so clearly money is \nnot the obstacle to getting back to school.\n  The new plan would give an additional $128.6 billion for schools, \naccording to the CBO, and, again, only 5 percent of that money would be \nspent by the end of this fiscal year, only about $6.5 billion. The rest \nof the money would be available over the next 7 years. Hopefully, that \nmoney is not money that is designed to get kids back to school. We \ndon't need to be waiting 7 years to get kids back to school.\n  If schools need money right now, they, first of all, should spend the \nmoney that the Congress has already provided. There is no reason to \nhave over $60 billion still waiting to be spent if that is what it \ntakes to get kids back to school.\n  This probably isn't about funding. It is really a discussion about \nwhether the schools should reopen and what else we need to do with \nmoney that might be available right now because of this coronavirus \nlegislation.\n  We need to be sure we get back to school. Our goal should not be to \nkeep the schools closed. If it is, why are we providing all this extra \nmoney so that schools can reopen, even though it will be a long time \nbefore that is spent?\n  I started out my career, after college, as a high school history \nteacher and then later I was a university president. I know the \nchallenges educators face every day and the ways well-meaning policy \nexperts sometimes miss the reality of the classroom. I also know that \nteachers are used to big challenges. They see them every day. They meet \nthem every day. They do their best every day to overcome the challenges \nin front of them. Teachers want to help kids learn, and they don't know \nwhat to do when they can't have the contact they need to have with the \nkids. They know that kids won't be doing as well as they need to do, in \nmore cases than not, until they are back to school.\n  In a recent Axios poll, teachers said they would return to school and \nare ready to do that. It is really time for a commonsense appraisal of \nwhat needs to be done to get kids back in school. This should not be \nsomething that we wait till next fall to do. It is something that needs \nto happen right now.\n  The CDC guidelines are helpful, but they need to be more flexible. We \nneed to constantly look at all the data. As people working hard to get \nkids back to school, we need to be sure that we understand where that \nis working, why that is working, how that is working, and we are \ngetting that information out to school districts all over America. It \nis time to go back to school.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, the experts, the health officials, and the \ndata have made it clear, we can and we should safely reopen our \nschools. But parents, students, and even some teachers are asking the \nquestion: Why have we failed to do that?\n  There is a pretty simple answer. Politicians are putting political \ninterests ahead of the livelihoods of our kids and of our families. \nAccording to the science presented by the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention, CDC, schools can dust off their books and safely open \nup classrooms to students with commonsense precautions.\n  Transmission of COVID among students is relatively rare, and \nclassrooms have not been a significant source of community \ntransmission, according to the CDC. Furthermore, the CDC says ``it is \npossible for communities to reduce the incidence of COVID-19 while \nkeeping schools open for in-person instruction.''\n  So what is the holdup? Despite his CDC's own advice, President \nBiden's administration continues to play games, to ignore the science, \nand to send mixed messages to the American people.\n  Their lack of clarity and their reluctance to get students back in \nthe classroom is a detriment to our children, our working families, and \nour economy.\n  Just recently, President Biden's own CDC Director stated that the \n``vaccination of teachers is not''--not--``a prerequisite for safe \nreopening of schools'' and that ``there is increasing data to suggest \nthat schools can safely reopen.'' But shortly after her statement, the \nWhite House Press Secretary moved the goalposts once again, claiming \nthat the Biden administration's aim is to have more than 50 percent of \nthe schools offer ``some teaching'' in person ``at least one''--one \n``day a week'' by the 100th day of Joe Biden's Presidency. One day a \nweek, folks. Yes, you heard it right, have kids in school only one day \nper week and no sooner than the end of April.\n  Just days after this, after coming under immense pressure from the \nAmerican people, including folks on the left, the President moved the \ngoalposts again and threw his communications staff under the bus--a \nschoolbus--for the one-day-a-week goal.\n  Folks, our youngest generation is falling behind. Virtual learning \ndoes not give them the attention they need to be successful, and the \nisolation it creates has had an enormous impact on their mental health.\n  But it is not just impacting our kids. The closure of schools and \nchildcare centers has disproportionately impacted women, most notably \nour moms. An analysis from the National Women's Law Center found that \n275,000 women left the workforce in January alone, with many staying \nhome to care\n\n[[Page S842]]\n\nfor their kids and often becoming their de facto teachers and tutors.\n  Women across the country have made enormous strides in all fields of \nservice, and our moms shouldn't be forced to put their careers on hold \nbecause our schools, at the direction of this administration, are \nfailing to do their jobs.\n  In Iowa, because of Governor Reynolds' bold leadership, many of our \nkids have safely been back at school since August. The Iowa General \nAssembly passed and the Governor signed legislation to require safe in-\nperson learning in our State's public school system. Now the rest of \nthe country needs to follow Iowa's lead and get our kids safely back in \nthe classroom.\n  At the Federal level, I am helping lead an effort that would require \nschools to offer a safe in-person learning option to students by April \n30, 2021.\n  It is increasingly clear that the Biden administration, one that \nprides itself on following the science, is actually more loyal to \nleftwing special interests than the well-being of our kids. Science, \nnot special interests, should be guiding these decisions, and that \nmeans Washington should not be locking students out of the classroom.\n  This type of meddling is precisely why I have always been leery of \nthe overinvolvement of the Federal Government in education. So to get \nour bureaucrats and special interests out of way and to put students \nfirst, I am helping lead that effort to require schools to offer safe \nin-person learning to our students by April 30, 2021.\n  To guide us through this pandemic, I suggest we follow these revised \nand updated three r's of education: first, respect the science; second, \nreopen our schools safely; and third, return students, teachers, and \nlearning to the classroom.\n  It is long past time schools across the country follow the science \nand the data. Let's do the right thing by safely getting our kids back \nin the classroom and help get our parents back to work. The well-being \nof our children, our working moms and dads, and our Nation's economy \ndepend on it.\n  Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia\n  Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from the \ngreat State of Iowa for bringing forth her three r's. I think they are \nvery succinct. They are the message that certainly I want to convey \nwith my colleague from the great State of Florida here today: respect \nthe science, reopen the schools safely, and return students, teachers, \nand learning to the classroom.\n  A year ago, we were only just starting to realize what COVID-19 was \nabout, almost a year to this date practically. Yet no one could have \nforeseen that many children would leave their classrooms in 2020 and \nstill not have returned in March of 2021.\n  Fortunately, during these past few months, we have come a long way in \nour knowledge of COVID-19. We knew little about how the virus spread \nwhen most schools closed last March, but now experts have had the \nopportunity to learn more about the spread of the disease, specifically \nas it would spread in a K-12 school environment.\n  At the end of January, the CDC, the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, published data showing that in-person learning for K-12 \nstudents with limited in-school COVID-19 spread is, indeed, possible. \nThe schools studied adhered to the public health practices many of us \nhave followed--wearing a mask, social distancing, washing hands, \navoiding large groups, and quarantining after exposure to the virus.\n  Since this data was released, CDC has gone on and issued additional \nguidance for reopening our schools. This guidance focuses on many of \nthe same public health strategies as well as cleaning facilities and \nadditional ventilation.\n  In addition to the improved knowledge of how COVID-19 affects our \nschools, we also have safe and effective vaccines. By enabling our \nteachers and other education professionals to have the vaccine on a \npriority basis, we continue to forge ahead with reopening our schools.\n  Yesterday, Dr. Clay Marsh, who is our State's coronavirus czar--he \nhas done an incredibly great job. He has also led our efforts in our \nsuccessful vaccine efforts. And I want to remind the Nation that West \nVirginia is No. 1 in vaccine distribution per capita. We have done a \nfantastic job.\n  Dr. Marsh said yesterday:\n\n       The classroom is a safe place to be.\n\n  He continued by saying:\n\n       The K-8 classroom--there is a tremendous amount of really \n     good data to suggest that it is even a safer place to be than \n     staying in your community.\n\n  Following these comments, our State's board of education voted in \nfavor of our students in kindergarten through eighth grade returning to \na full 5-day, in-person learning. It had some blended, some in class, \nand some at home.\n  While data we have seen makes a very compelling case for why we can \nget children safely back into the classroom with the right mitigations, \nother realities make it even more necessary.\n  With the option of remote learning at home, there are still many \nchildren--especially in States like mine, West Virginia--who struggle \nwith connectivity. Despite robust funding from Congress to attempt to \naddress these issues, the digital divide is very real, and it begins to \nexacerbate the have-and-have-not phenomenon. As a result, these \nchildren can be affected for years.\n  I hear concerns from parents all over my State. Last year, I had a \nMercer County principal tell me that many of the students' parents in \ntheir class had to drive their students to a parking lot of a fast food \nrestaurant so they could get Wi-Fi so they could do their homework.\n  A constituent from Lewis County recently wrote to my office \nexpressing her frustration with balancing her work with also the remote \nlearning that her children are doing. To make matters worse, they can't \nget on the internet at the same time in their home.\n  Another parent from Berkeley County wrote to me with a heartbreaking \nstory about how her daughter cries at the computer because she requires \nextra help on certain assignments. Parents helping their children on \nschoolwork can only go so far. In-person attention is absolutely \nnecessary and something that the internet can't solve through a Zoom \nmeeting or a video meeting or what a lot of this is--going to certain \nassignments on your computer where there is nobody to interact with \nwhatsoever.\n  These are very real concerns that parents have, a fear that their \nchildren will fall behind and are falling behind without access to \ntheir schoolwork.\n  Even more disturbing are the concerns I have heard from child abuse \nadvocates throughout our State. The heightened stress, school closures, \nloss of income, and social isolation from this pandemic have increased \nthe risk of child abuse and neglect. Yet, without the safe space of the \nschool and the watchful eyes of our teachers and other caring \nprofessionals, I fear too many children are falling through the cracks \nand would have nowhere to turn\n  Last week, our West Virginia DHHR deputy secretary said there were \n8,000 fewer referrals to child protective services this year in our \nState. Sadly, we know it is not because it is not occurring; it is \nbecause teachers and school employees aren't there to notice the abuse \nand neglect and report it. This is where our teachers are so incredibly \ncaring and invaluable.\n  According to data from the CDC, between April and October of 2020, \nemergency departments nationwide have experienced a rise in the share \nof total visits from children with mental health needs. In my State of \nWest Virginia, our State board of education has reported a spike in \nattempted suicides in Cabell County.\n  In addition, parents have had to make hard decisions as they attempt \nto balance their careers with their children's education, especially \nmore difficult for those parents of younger children who can't leave \ntheir child at home for any period of time as they are doing their \nschoolwork.\n  As more workers are being asked to physically return to their \nworkplaces, the lack of in-person learning and adequate childcare is \nhindering many from returning to work. This is especially true for many \nwomen who work outside the home. In fact, many women are having to quit \ntheir jobs as a result.\n  According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the January \njobs report showed that some 275,000 women\n\n[[Page S843]]\n\nleft the workforce, while about 71,000 men left the workforce. Overall, \napproximately 2.4 million women have left the workforce since last \nFebruary. This has been a common and unfortunate trend we are seeing as \na result of the pandemic, and I know for certain it is definitely tied \nto the fact that schools have not reopened.\n  West Virginia's State superintendent said recently:\n\n       There is absolutely no substitution for a teacher in the \n     lives of a child.\n\n  He continued by saying:\n\n       There is no substitution for what that means to the \n     community and the families--not just for the academics but \n     for the social, emotional, [and] physical well-being.\n\n  He is absolutely right, and this is just another reason why it is so \nimportant for our children to return to school safely.\n  At the same time, I know there is no one-size-fits-all solution. \nState leaders, local governments, school administrators, and parents \nmust take this data and these recommendations and apply them to the \nrealities they see in their own communities.\n  Congress has provided $68 billion in resources for K-12 schools that \nthey could use last year, which schools could use to implement these \nstrategies. For these, this may mean continuing some form of remote \nlearning. For others, including my State of West Virginia, it means \nbringing every K-8 student to a 5-day school week.\n  Before I conclude, I want to take a moment to thank the teachers, the \nparents, and the students who have adjusted and readjusted over the \npast years.\n  Despite the many challenges--whether they are technical, logistical, \nor emotional challenges--you have tried to make it work the best you \ncan, and for that we are all very grateful. But now we have to do the \nthree r's. We must look at the data, listen to the stories, and look at \nthe realities in our classrooms and in our communities.\n  Get our children back to school. Respect the science. Reopen the \nschools safely, and return students, teachers, and learning to the \nclassroom, where it should be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, I first want to thank my \ncolleague from West Virginia and my colleague from Iowa for their focus \non getting our kids back in school.\n  I agree with the three r's: respect the science, reopen our schools \nsafely, and return our teachers and our children to our classrooms.\n  It has been almost a year since schools first shuttered due to COVID-\n19. In many States across the Nation, unfortunately, schools remain \nclosed. The consequences are devastating. Being forced to stay at home \nis taking a significant social and emotional toll, and it also directly \nimpacts our children's future.\n  Continuing to subject kids to this unnecessary virtual-learning \nsystem is not backed by science or facts. I applaud my State of Florida \nfor getting schools reopened quickly and safely.\n  The science is overwhelming and clear about reopening our Nation's \nschools. It is safe, and it is necessary for the well-being and the \nfuture of students. The CDC confirmed last month that in-person \ninstruction does not pose an increased risk of community transmission. \nSchools can and should be open, and they can do so safely.\n  We need to be honest about why we are even having this conversation \ntoday. The only reason schools across the Nation remain closed is \nbecause my Democratic colleagues and the Biden administration are \nstanding with teachers unions instead of standing up for our children.\n  For months, we have heard Democrats preach about following the \nscience, but now Democrats don't want to acknowledge the scientific \nevidence that school reopenings are safe. They are blindly following \nthe teachers unions because they are afraid of losing campaign \ncontributions, and they are pushing a lie that schools can't reopen \nwithout more taxpayer money.\n  Here is the truth: The funding they claim is absolutely necessary for \nschools to reopen would not even be allocated for 2 or 3 years. \nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, Biden's COVID spending \nbill would distribute only $6.4 billion to K-12 schools this year. The \nremaining $122 billion would be spent between the years 2022 and 2028.\n  Here is another fact: Congress has already provided $68 billion for \nK-12 schools, but so far States have spent just $4 billion of that \nmoney. Schools don't need more money to open safely. Yet the Biden \nadministration keeps clinging to this lie and doing everything possible \nto keep schools closed.\n  Last week, Speaker Pelosi said:\n\n       We want as many kids to be back in school as possible. For \n     that to happen, it takes some money.\n\n  Also last week, Vice President Harris would not directly answer \nwhether it is safe for teachers to go back to school if they are not \nvaccinated, despite clear CDC guidelines that it is not a prerequisite \nif other safety measures are in place.\n  And earlier this month, all 50 Senate Democrats voted against \nstudents safely returning to classrooms even after teachers have been \nvaccinated. We all agree that teachers should be able to receive \nvaccinations. I will work with any of my colleagues on a way to get \nvaccines to teachers more quickly.\n  We all agree that schools should have additional resources to ensure \nour students and teachers have safe, clean, and healthy classrooms, and \nwe have allocated $68 billion to do just that right now. But keeping \nschools closed doesn't make sense. It is hurting our children and \nAmerica's poorest families the most.\n  I grew up in a poor family that struggled to make ends meet, and \neducation was life-changing for me, just as it is for families across \nour great country. Every student in this Nation deserves the option of \nin-person learning.\n  It is time for the Biden administration to acknowledge that the best \nplace for children to learn is in the classroom, and it is time for my \nDemocratic colleagues and the President to stop putting union bosses \nahead of America's students and families.\n  Let's get our schools open now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Rosen). The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "Reopening Schools\n\n\tMr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, in recent days the Biden administration has backed away from its original goal to reopen most schools within the first 100 days. This comes despite new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention research recommending that schools can safely reopen for in-person instruction.\n\tArkansas schools reopened their doors in August of 2020. Currently, the Arkansas Department of Education reports that 67 percent of K-12 students are attending school in-person full time, almost 13 percent have a hybrid schedule, and 20 percent are entirely remote.\n\tNatural State school districts invested in cleaning supplies, barriers, and retrofitting classrooms. Educators thought creatively and found solutions to these new problems. And although every school and community has different challenges, they moved ahead with the same goal: finding the best and the safest way to get and keep children and teachers in the classroom.\n\tI had the opportunity to visit several school districts last fall. I was so impressed with their daily efforts to keep their doors open, keep their staff healthy, and provide the learning that children desperately need.\n\tThese heroes need our support. Over the course of this past year, Congress has delivered $113 billion--and over $686 million to Arkansas--to support education through the COVID-19 pandemic, including nearly $68 billion to help bring K-12 students back into the classroom. That money is already hard at work. However, much of it remains to be spent.\n\tParents can see that virtual learning simply isn't working. If you need more evidence of the unbalanced impact of 100-percent virtual learning, a study by the RAND Corporation in fall 2020 highlighted tremendous areas of concern. Researchers surveyed educators across the country and concluded that State and Federal Governments needed to prioritize making schools safe to attend. One particularly shocking result of the survey found that principals in America's highest poverty schools reported only 80 percent of their students had adequate internet access at home. When schools are virtual, we are knowingly failing 20 percent of those students without even getting to the question of how effective the instruction is or addressing the negative effects on students' social needs and development.\n\tThis crisis in education also means that families are falling behind. Women, in particular, are shouldering an incredible burden through this pandemic. In February 2020, women held the majority of nonfarm payroll jobs. They outnumbered men in the workforce for the first time in American history. Today, the number of women in the workforce is at a 33-year low. Much of this is attributed to the outsized role women are playing in balancing their families' financial, educational, and caregiving needs.\n\tOf all the challenges we have faced through the COVID-19 pandemic, the mission of educating children continues to be one of the most critical and complex. It has been rewarding to see educators receive their much needed COVID-19 vaccine. These heroes are essential to our recovery.\n\tArkansas is setting the example. The Natural State can be proud of the teachers, administrators, and elected leaders who continue to find ways to keep schools open and provide critical services that children deserve. It is time that students in other States have the same opportunities.\n\tI suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\tThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n\tThe bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\tMr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n\tThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tMr. BLUNT. Mr. President, a year ago, schools began to close due to the coronavirus. Teachers quickly scrambled to try to figure out how they were going to teach kids who weren't there. They set up virtual classrooms on the internet. Parents started googling activities to keep their children motivated and active, but they didn't start that a year ago. They started 11 months ago. It didn't take long to figure out that kids at home are different than kids at school. And even before that, many parents had to start accommodating their schedule to try to figure out how they were going to deal with this new and unanticipated schedule.\n\tCongress stepped up. On multiple occasions, we passed emergency legislation to get money to schools to clean classrooms, to buy laptops for students, and to do almost anything else that schools thought they might need at the elementary and secondary level. But what started as what I believe everybody thought was a stopgap--certainly no longer than until the weather got hot in the summertime as we finished up the last school year--has become, in many places, permanent, full time now, where students for a year have not been in school. That is despite a lot of widespread consensus that both scientists and medical experts think that kids can be back in the classroom.\n\tThe science on studying and learning is also clear that when schools are closed, students suffer. There have been a lot of studies to show that prolonged remote learning puts kids at higher risk for falling behind, for failing classes, for suffering from mental health problems, and, in many cases, just deciding not to show up. And, you know, the one thing about virtual is it is pretty easy to not virtually be there as well.\n\tThe risks on all those areas--the mental health problems, the falling behind, the failing grades--are even greater for students with disabilities or for minorities or people who live in generally underserved areas. A study by McKinsey looked at the toll prolonged remote learning has taken on students. It estimated that when it comes to mathematics, students, on average, are likely to lose 5 to 9 months of learning by the end of this school year. It said that students of color--this is according to McKinsey--could be 6 to 12 months behind at the end of this school year. Think about that. One year of remote learning could leave students 1 year behind where they should be in math if you look at these expert studies.\n\tIn addition to the academic damage, remote learning has led to an increase in mental health challenges facing students. A report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that mental health problems accounted for a growing proportion of students' visits to hospital emergency rooms. Visits were up 31 percent for kids between ages 12 and 17 and 24 percent for kids between ages 5 and 11, and according to the CDC, many of those visits are based on a mental health challenge rather than some other kind of health challenge.\n\tThe risk of keeping kids at home are significant. What is worse, they are unnecessary by the growing number of people who are looking at this. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, who is the head of CDC, recently appointed by President Biden--she began her work there on January 21--talked about what we should do earlier this month. She said that there was ``increasing data''--``increasing data that schools can safely reopen.'' That ends the quote, but she went on to say, even if teachers aren't vaccinated for the virus.\n\tAnthony Fauci--Dr. Fauci echoed that point. He said: ``I would back the CDC recommendation because that is really based on data . . . we need to try and get the children back to school.'' That ends Dr. Fauci's quote. He went on a step further by saying that it is not even workable to wait for every teacher to be vaccinated before schools reopen because, when you think about that, if every teacher had their first vaccine today in the double-vaccine world we are still in, it will be the end of March before every teacher had their second vaccine, and you are so far down the line, before you know it, the school might not be able to reopen in that circumstance.\n\tDr. David Rosen, a professor of pediatric infectious diseases at Washington University in St. Louis, said:\n\n       There is no situation in which schools can't be open unless \n     they have evidence of in-school transmission.\n\n\tThe Biden White House actually immediately said they just didn't agree with the experts on this, even the ones in their own administration. The President's Press Secretary said that Dr. Walensky was speaking in her personal capacity when she said that you can go back to school even if teachers weren't vaccinated, even though she was speaking in an official White House coronavirus briefing. Now, how the head of the CDC speaks in her personal capacity at an official White House coronavirus briefing on this topic, I don't know, but that is what happened\n\tThe White House just keeps repeating these points that teachers should be a priority for vaccination. I don't have a problem with that. I think that would be a great thing. It would make teachers more comfortable and might make parents more comfortable. In fact, when we were debating the budget resolution just a couple of weeks ago, I offered an amendment that would have incentivized school districts to get kids back to school after teachers had been vaccinated. That is more stringent than the President himself has said and more stringent than the CDC has said, but my amendment was blocked on a party-line vote. Every single Member of our friends on the other side voted against an amendment that would say we should incentivize, financially, getting kids back to school when teachers have been vaccinated.\n\tNow, a couple of my friends on the other side walked up and said: Well, we just need to work this language a little bit because all of us that have kids know how important it is that we get our kids back to school. Democrats say we need emergency legislation to help the schools. I have been part of five bills that did that, and we provided $67.5 billion for K-12 schools to reopen safely. So far, States have spent just under $7 billion of that $67 billion, so clearly money is not the obstacle to getting back to school.\n\tThe new plan would give an additional $128.6 billion for schools, according to the CBO, and, again, only 5 percent of that money would be spent by the end of this fiscal year, only about $6.5 billion. The rest of the money would be available over the next 7 years. Hopefully, that money is not money that is designed to get kids back to school. We don't need to be waiting 7 years to get kids back to school.\n\tIf schools need money right now, they, first of all, should spend the money that the Congress has already provided. There is no reason to have over $60 billion still waiting to be spent if that is what it takes to get kids back to school.\n\tThis probably isn't about funding. It is really a discussion about whether the schools should reopen and what else we need to do with money that might be available right now because of this coronavirus legislation.\n\tWe need to be sure we get back to school. Our goal should not be to keep the schools closed. If it is, why are we providing all this extra money so that schools can reopen, even though it will be a long time before that is spent?\n\tI started out my career, after college, as a high school history teacher and then later I was a university president. I know the challenges educators face every day and the ways well-meaning policy experts sometimes miss the reality of the classroom. I also know that teachers are used to big challenges. They see them every day. They meet them every day. They do their best every day to overcome the challenges in front of them. Teachers want to help kids learn, and they don't know what to do when they can't have the contact they need to have with the kids. They know that kids won't be doing as well as they need to do, in more cases than not, until they are back to school.\n\tIn a recent Axios poll, teachers said they would return to school and are ready to do that. It is really time for a commonsense appraisal of what needs to be done to get kids back in school. This should not be something that we wait till next fall to do. It is something that needs to happen right now.\n\tThe CDC guidelines are helpful, but they need to be more flexible. We need to constantly look at all the data. As people working hard to get kids back to school, we need to be sure that we understand where that is working, why that is working, how that is working, and we are getting that information out to school districts all over America. It is time to go back to school.\n\tI yield the floor.\n\tThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n\tMs. ERNST. Mr. President, the experts, the health officials, and the data have made it clear, we can and we should safely reopen our schools. But parents, students, and even some teachers are asking the question: Why have we failed to do that?\n\tThere is a pretty simple answer. Politicians are putting political interests ahead of the livelihoods of our kids and of our families. According to the science presented by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, schools can dust off their books and safely open up classrooms to students with commonsense precautions.\n\tTransmission of COVID among students is relatively rare, and classrooms have not been a significant source of community transmission, according to the CDC. Furthermore, the CDC says ``it is possible for communities to reduce the incidence of COVID-19 while keeping schools open for in-person instruction.''\n\tSo what is the holdup? Despite his CDC's own advice, President Biden's administration continues to play games, to ignore the science, and to send mixed messages to the American people.\n\tTheir lack of clarity and their reluctance to get students back in the classroom is a detriment to our children, our working families, and our economy.\n\tJust recently, President Biden's own CDC Director stated that the ``vaccination of teachers is not''--not--``a prerequisite for safe reopening of schools'' and that ``there is increasing data to suggest that schools can safely reopen.'' But shortly after her statement, the White House Press Secretary moved the goalposts once again, claiming that the Biden administration's aim is to have more than 50 percent of the schools offer ``some teaching'' in person ``at least one''--one ``day a week'' by the 100th day of Joe Biden's Presidency. One day a week, folks. Yes, you heard it right, have kids in school only one day per week and no sooner than the end of April.\n\tJust days after this, after coming under immense pressure from the American people, including folks on the left, the President moved the goalposts again and threw his communications staff under the bus--a schoolbus--for the one-day-a-week goal.\n\tFolks, our youngest generation is falling behind. Virtual learning does not give them the attention they need to be successful, and the isolation it creates has had an enormous impact on their mental health.\n\tBut it is not just impacting our kids. The closure of schools and childcare centers has disproportionately impacted women, most notably our moms. An analysis from the National Women's Law Center found that 275,000 women left the workforce in January alone, with many staying home to care for their kids and often becoming their de facto teachers and tutors.\n\tWomen across the country have made enormous strides in all fields of service, and our moms shouldn't be forced to put their careers on hold because our schools, at the direction of this administration, are failing to do their jobs.\n\tIn Iowa, because of Governor Reynolds' bold leadership, many of our kids have safely been back at school since August. The Iowa General Assembly passed and the Governor signed legislation to require safe in-person learning in our State's public school system. Now the rest of the country needs to follow Iowa's lead and get our kids safely back in the classroom.\n\tAt the Federal level, I am helping lead an effort that would require schools to offer a safe in-person learning option to students by April 30, 2021.\n\tIt is increasingly clear that the Biden administration, one that prides itself on following the science, is actually more loyal to leftwing special interests than the well-being of our kids. Science, not special interests, should be guiding these decisions, and that means Washington should not be locking students out of the classroom.\n\tThis type of meddling is precisely why I have always been leery of the overinvolvement of the Federal Government in education. So to get our bureaucrats and special interests out of way and to put students first, I am helping lead that effort to require schools to offer safe in-person learning to our students by April 30, 2021.\n\tTo guide us through this pandemic, I suggest we follow these revised and updated three r's of education: first, respect the science; second, reopen our schools safely; and third, return students, teachers, and learning to the classroom.\n\tIt is long past time schools across the country follow the science and the data. Let's do the right thing by safely getting our kids back in the classroom and help get our parents back to work. The well-being of our children, our working moms and dads, and our Nation's economy depend on it.\n\tThank you.\n\tI yield the floor.\n\tThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia\n\tMrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from the great State of Iowa for bringing forth her three r's. I think they are very succinct. They are the message that certainly I want to convey with my colleague from the great State of Florida here today: respect the science, reopen the schools safely, and return students, teachers, and learning to the classroom.\n\tA year ago, we were only just starting to realize what COVID-19 was about, almost a year to this date practically. Yet no one could have foreseen that many children would leave their classrooms in 2020 and still not have returned in March of 2021.\n\tFortunately, during these past few months, we have come a long way in our knowledge of COVID-19. We knew little about how the virus spread when most schools closed last March, but now experts have had the opportunity to learn more about the spread of the disease, specifically as it would spread in a K-12 school environment.\n\tAt the end of January, the CDC, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, published data showing that in-person learning for K-12 students with limited in-school COVID-19 spread is, indeed, possible. The schools studied adhered to the public health practices many of us have followed--wearing a mask, social distancing, washing hands, avoiding large groups, and quarantining after exposure to the virus.\n\tSince this data was released, CDC has gone on and issued additional guidance for reopening our schools. This guidance focuses on many of the same public health strategies as well as cleaning facilities and additional ventilation.\n\tIn addition to the improved knowledge of how COVID-19 affects our schools, we also have safe and effective vaccines. By enabling our teachers and other education professionals to have the vaccine on a priority basis, we continue to forge ahead with reopening our schools.\n\tYesterday, Dr. Clay Marsh, who is our State's coronavirus czar--he has done an incredibly great job. He has also led our efforts in our successful vaccine efforts. And I want to remind the Nation that West Virginia is No. 1 in vaccine distribution per capita. We have done a fantastic job.\n\tDr. Marsh said yesterday:\n\n       The classroom is a safe place to be.\n\n\tHe continued by saying:\n\n       The K-8 classroom--there is a tremendous amount of really \n     good data to suggest that it is even a safer place to be than \n     staying in your community.\n\n\tFollowing these comments, our State's board of education voted in favor of our students in kindergarten through eighth grade returning to a full 5-day, in-person learning. It had some blended, some in class, and some at home.\n\tWhile data we have seen makes a very compelling case for why we can get children safely back into the classroom with the right mitigations, other realities make it even more necessary.\n\tWith the option of remote learning at home, there are still many children--especially in States like mine, West Virginia--who struggle with connectivity. Despite robust funding from Congress to attempt to address these issues, the digital divide is very real, and it begins to exacerbate the have-and-have-not phenomenon. As a result, these children can be affected for years.\n\tI hear concerns from parents all over my State. Last year, I had a Mercer County principal tell me that many of the students' parents in their class had to drive their students to a parking lot of a fast food restaurant so they could get Wi-Fi so they could do their homework.\n\tA constituent from Lewis County recently wrote to my office expressing her frustration with balancing her work with also the remote learning that her children are doing. To make matters worse, they can't get on the internet at the same time in their home.\n\tAnother parent from Berkeley County wrote to me with a heartbreaking story about how her daughter cries at the computer because she requires extra help on certain assignments. Parents helping their children on schoolwork can only go so far. In-person attention is absolutely necessary and something that the internet can't solve through a Zoom meeting or a video meeting or what a lot of this is--going to certain assignments on your computer where there is nobody to interact with whatsoever.\n\tThese are very real concerns that parents have, a fear that their children will fall behind and are falling behind without access to their schoolwork.\n\tEven more disturbing are the concerns I have heard from child abuse advocates throughout our State. The heightened stress, school closures, loss of income, and social isolation from this pandemic have increased the risk of child abuse and neglect. Yet, without the safe space of the school and the watchful eyes of our teachers and other caring professionals, I fear too many children are falling through the cracks and would have nowhere to turn\n\tLast week, our West Virginia DHHR deputy secretary said there were 8,000 fewer referrals to child protective services this year in our State. Sadly, we know it is not because it is not occurring; it is because teachers and school employees aren't there to notice the abuse and neglect and report it. This is where our teachers are so incredibly caring and invaluable.\n\tAccording to data from the CDC, between April and October of 2020, emergency departments nationwide have experienced a rise in the share of total visits from children with mental health needs. In my State of West Virginia, our State board of education has reported a spike in attempted suicides in Cabell County.\n\tIn addition, parents have had to make hard decisions as they attempt to balance their careers with their children's education, especially more difficult for those parents of younger children who can't leave their child at home for any period of time as they are doing their schoolwork.\n\tAs more workers are being asked to physically return to their workplaces, the lack of in-person learning and adequate childcare is hindering many from returning to work. This is especially true for many women who work outside the home. In fact, many women are having to quit their jobs as a result.\n\tAccording to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the January jobs report showed that some 275,000 women left the workforce, while about 71,000 men left the workforce. Overall, approximately 2.4 million women have left the workforce since last February. This has been a common and unfortunate trend we are seeing as a result of the pandemic, and I know for certain it is definitely tied to the fact that schools have not reopened.\n\tWest Virginia's State superintendent said recently:\n\n       There is absolutely no substitution for a teacher in the \n     lives of a child.\n\n\tHe continued by saying:\n\n       There is no substitution for what that means to the \n     community and the families--not just for the academics but \n     for the social, emotional, [and] physical well-being.\n\n\tHe is absolutely right, and this is just another reason why it is so important for our children to return to school safely.\n\tAt the same time, I know there is no one-size-fits-all solution. State leaders, local governments, school administrators, and parents must take this data and these recommendations and apply them to the realities they see in their own communities.\n\tCongress has provided $68 billion in resources for K-12 schools that they could use last year, which schools could use to implement these strategies. For these, this may mean continuing some form of remote learning. For others, including my State of West Virginia, it means bringing every K-8 student to a 5-day school week.\n\tBefore I conclude, I want to take a moment to thank the teachers, the parents, and the students who have adjusted and readjusted over the past years.\n\tDespite the many challenges--whether they are technical, logistical, or emotional challenges--you have tried to make it work the best you can, and for that we are all very grateful. But now we have to do the three r's. We must look at the data, listen to the stories, and look at the realities in our classrooms and in our communities.\n\tGet our children back to school. Respect the science. Reopen the schools safely, and return students, teachers, and learning to the classroom, where it should be.\n\tI yield the floor.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). The Senator from Florida.\n\tMr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, I first want to thank my colleague from West Virginia and my colleague from Iowa for their focus on getting our kids back in school.\n\tI agree with the three r's: respect the science, reopen our schools safely, and return our teachers and our children to our classrooms.\n\tIt has been almost a year since schools first shuttered due to COVID-19. In many States across the Nation, unfortunately, schools remain closed. The consequences are devastating. Being forced to stay at home is taking a significant social and emotional toll, and it also directly impacts our children's future.\n\tContinuing to subject kids to this unnecessary virtual-learning system is not backed by science or facts. I applaud my State of Florida for getting schools reopened quickly and safely.\n\tThe science is overwhelming and clear about reopening our Nation's schools. It is safe, and it is necessary for the well-being and the future of students. The CDC confirmed last month that in-person instruction does not pose an increased risk of community transmission. Schools can and should be open, and they can do so safely.\n\tWe need to be honest about why we are even having this conversation today. The only reason schools across the Nation remain closed is because my Democratic colleagues and the Biden administration are standing with teachers unions instead of standing up for our children.\n\tFor months, we have heard Democrats preach about following the science, but now Democrats don't want to acknowledge the scientific evidence that school reopenings are safe. They are blindly following the teachers unions because they are afraid of losing campaign contributions, and they are pushing a lie that schools can't reopen without more taxpayer money.\n\tHere is the truth: The funding they claim is absolutely necessary for schools to reopen would not even be allocated for 2 or 3 years. According to the Congressional Budget Office, Biden's COVID spending bill would distribute only $6.4 billion to K-12 schools this year. The remaining $122 billion would be spent between the years 2022 and 2028.\n\tHere is another fact: Congress has already provided $68 billion for K-12 schools, but so far States have spent just $4 billion of that money. Schools don't need more money to open safely. Yet the Biden administration keeps clinging to this lie and doing everything possible to keep schools closed.\n\tLast week, Speaker Pelosi said:\n\n       We want as many kids to be back in school as possible. For \n     that to happen, it takes some money.\n\n\tAlso last week, Vice President Harris would not directly answer whether it is safe for teachers to go back to school if they are not vaccinated, despite clear CDC guidelines that it is not a prerequisite if other safety measures are in place.\n\tAnd earlier this month, all 50 Senate Democrats voted against students safely returning to classrooms even after teachers have been vaccinated. We all agree that teachers should be able to receive vaccinations. I will work with any of my colleagues on a way to get vaccines to teachers more quickly.\n\tWe all agree that schools should have additional resources to ensure our students and teachers have safe, clean, and healthy classrooms, and we have allocated $68 billion to do just that right now. But keeping schools closed doesn't make sense. It is hurting our children and America's poorest families the most.\n\tI grew up in a poor family that struggled to make ends meet, and education was life-changing for me, just as it is for families across our great country. Every student in this Nation deserves the option of in-person learning.\n\tIt is time for the Biden administration to acknowledge that the best place for children to learn is in the classroom, and it is time for my Democratic colleagues and the President to stop putting union bosses ahead of America's students and families.\n\tLet's get our schools open now.\n\tI yield the floor.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Rosen).

Madam President, I come to the floor today, as I have \ndone twice before over the past month, to sound the alarm about the new \nadministration's attacks on American energy. Yet there is still more to \ntalk about.\n  President Biden has continued this assault on American energy as well \nas the American economy. Now he is taking that attack further. He is \ntaking the attack on energy around the world as well as attacking the \nneeds for energy of a number of our allies around the world. President \nBiden signed an Executive order to cut off all loans for coal, oil, and \ngas projects in some of the poorest nations in the world.\n  Now, some of these nations are our friends that we work with and we \ntry to help, and these are people who desperately need affordable \nenergy, and they don't have it.\n  Democrats close to the administration have reported that what the \nadministration and President Biden are trying to do is to ``isolate'' \nthe Chinese Communist Party.\n  The Biden administration thinks that by refusing to make these loans \nto folks around the world, that the Chinese Communist Party will be \nshamed for using fossil fuels for energy and will shame the Communist \nParty of China for loans that they make to countries to develop coal-\nfired powerplants, natural gas plants, and other projects that use \nfossil fuel.\n  Let me tell you, the Chinese Communist Party will not be shamed. \nChina has a totalitarian regime; China puts Uighurs in concentration \ncamps. So I am not sure what makes President Biden and his \nadministration think that the Chinese Communist Party will be ashamed \nof using an affordable reliable source of energy--coal.\n  In reality, President Biden, by this Executive order, is giving China \na gift. President Biden is giving China another advantage on the world \nstage and putting ourselves at a disadvantage, if you think about it.\n  If the United States and those that we fund through the World Bank \nrefuse to provide loans to those countries to build the powerplants \nthat they need, that is going to leave a vacuum. They are going to need \nto use the resources that they have--if they have plenty of coal or \nnatural gas--and the Chinese Communist Party is going to come in and \nmake the loan.\n  China already funds 7 out of 10 new coal plants around the world, and \nthanks to President Biden's misguided effort, that is likely soon going \nto be close to 10 out of 10.\n  Just like President Biden's other energy orders, this new policy will \nmake China stronger. It will make America weaker. China will have more \ninfluence, and the United States will have less.\n  Now, this order is not going to hurt China at all. The people whom it \nwill hurt are those who look to the United States for help and for \nfriendship. It is going to especially hurt the 840 million people \naround the world who don't have access to electricity today.\n  Developing countries desperately need the electricity. They need it \nto be affordable. They need it to be reliable. So if you help \ndeveloping countries in terms of helping them get a stable supply of \nenergy, it is one of the best things we can do to help people around \nthe world in their fight against poverty.\n  Many parts of the world, countries with abundant energy resources, \njust need our help and turn to us for our help so they can use the \nresources that they have.\n  And let me give you a good example, Madam President, because you and \nI have traveled to various places around the world and had a chance to \nsee men and women in uniform and thank them for their services, as we \nhave done, and gone to battlefields, as we have had family members who \nhave served in the military and defended this country and our freedoms. \nAnd it has been a pleasure to be able to do that with you and share \nthat with your family because of our united heritage of fighting or our \nfamily history of fighting for the country.\n  So a good example of what I am talking about is Kosovo. I have been \nthere on three separate occasions specifically to visit members of our \ntroops--the men and women in uniform, people from Wyoming who are \nserving in Kosovo. I have been there three separate times. I was there \nin 2019, was there previously for Thanksgiving, was there on Easter \nSunday one time to be with the troops.\n  Well, Kosovo is one of the poorest nations in Europe, but it has vast \nenergy resources. Despite being physically smaller than the State of \nConnecticut, Kosovo has the fifth largest reserves of coal in the \nworld: small geography, massive resources of coal.\n  So the World Bank has cut off Kosovo's funding for a new state-of-\nthe-art coal-fired powerplant. They have old coal-fired powerplants. \nThey are burning coal right now.\n  I have talked to the leaders of the country, and they say: We need to \nbuild a new coal-fired powerplant. We need to borrow the money to do \nit.\n  Well, the World Bank has said it is only going to support new energy \nprojects from renewable sources. So this is what Kosovo's Minister of \nEconomic Development is saying. He said: ``In a poor country [like] \nKosovo . . . we don't have the luxury . . .''--the luxury of focusing \nonly on renewable sources when they don't have that much access to \nrenewable energy. The wind doesn't blow that much; in terms of sunny \ndays, not at all during the winter, and they have this incredible \nresource of coal.\n  Well, the Minister of Economic Development is absolutely correct--\nbecause I have been there in the spring; I have been there in the \nwinter; I have been there different times throughout the year. \nDeveloping countries cannot afford the elitist environmental agendas of \nPresidents who become climate elitists, especially those being put in \ncharge of those issues, former Secretary of State John Kerry.\n  Let me repeat myself so--I want to just make this absolutely clear: \nWe, the United States, have peacekeeping troops in the country of \nKosovo. We have them right there in Kosovo. And we, the United States, \nare driving the Government of Kosovo into the clutches of the Communist \nChinese Party because of a holier-than-thou attitude of the climate \nalarmists in the White House.\n  So we pay to put our troops on the ground, and then we say: Go to \nChina if you need help providing power to your country.\n\n[[Page S845]]\n\n  People need affordable, reliable energy. Traditional energy projects \nare still the most affordable, still the most reliable.\n  If we really care about the people in developing countries, then we \nought to help them turn on the lights. So I urge the Biden \nadministration to reverse course, to rethink this, to look at all the \nimplications of the decisions they are making.\n  We need to stop this senseless attack on energy jobs. We need to stop \nthis reckless attack on developing nations. We need to stop pushing our \nallies into the waiting arms of the Chinese Communist Party.\n  The American people and our friends around the world--we are better \nthan what we are getting right now from this administration, and we \nneed to reverse course.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "Biden Administration\n\n\tMr. BARRASSO.

The Biden-Harris administration gives us opportunity to take \nmeaningful action in government to create a more just society. In the \nyear ahead, we must work together to advance the George Floyd Justice \nin Policing Act to bring accountability to law enforcement and the  \nJohn Lewis Voting Rights Act to combat voter suppression and restore \nthe Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n  It is our charge to mobilize all levels, from our communities to the \nOval Office, to advance social, economic, and civil rights and justice \nto all Americans.

Madam President, I know that some of my colleagues \nhave been talking about schools, getting children back to school, \ngetting schools reopened. Indeed, in Tennessee, that is a topic that \nhas received a good bit of conversation. All but two of our school \nsystems have been open and working this entire school year, and those \nother two systems have recently reopened since the first of the year. \nOur school superintendents, our directors of school, our parents, our \nteachers, and the students have all worked together as a team--a solid, \ncohesive team--to make this happen.\n  I think there are two main points that we have seen, and as we are \nholding meetings with our county elected officials and city officials \nand as they talk about the efforts that they have made in getting \nchildren back into the classroom, we hear a lot about one point. That \nis that our Governor, Tennessee Governor Bill Lee, made it clear that \nthe school districts would be responsible for the ``how'' they were \ngoing to open and the ``when'' they would be reopening. I really thank \nhim for listening and recognizing that local officials and individuals \nin the community really do know what is best for their school districts \nand their students.\n  The second point is that these plans didn't just drop out of the sky. \nAs I said, this has been a team effort in our communities, and it has \nhappened because there was this agreement between the administrators \nand the parents and the teachers that they were going to make decisions \nthat were going to be best for the children. So when you look at \nTennessee and how they have approached this--indeed, the schools \nreopening and how they proceeded--it was done with the children in \nmind.\n  Last week, I had the privilege of speaking with school administrators \nfrom West Tennessee, who played a part in developing their own \nreopening plans. I cannot adequately describe to you with the time that \nwe have on the floor today the amount of work and the thoughtfulness \nthat they put into these schedules, from health and safety \nconsiderations, to scheduling changes, to the complicated logistics of \nsocial distancing and cramped classrooms. They thought it all through \nby walking through the day and listening to what teachers and parents \nhad to say as to how they would walk through this day.\n  They took the millions of dollars in CARES Act funding that the area \nreceived, and what did they do with that money? They invested in the \nbest possible plan for these kids--no Federal mandate or sweeping \nlitmus test required. They said: We are going to do what is right by \nthese children.\n  Then, of course, they turned on the TV, and they saw that the Biden \nadministration was busy walking back their own enthusiastic scientific \nguidance on safely reopening schools--walking it back--and they didn't \nhave to flip too many channels to figure out why. Powerful teachers \nunions had taken their own stands in refusing to make a plan, in \nrefusing to think things through, and in some cases in refusing to go \nto work at all--not doing what is best for the children but doing what \nwas going to serve their interests first and, in their opinions, what \nwould best serve their interests. That, I think, they will see were \nregrettable actions.\n  Educators in Tennessee were not just confused by what they saw; they \nwere insulted because they knew exactly what was happening. On January \n26, CDC officials released a study showing that, if we were careful, \nsafe reopening was indeed possible. Administration officials touted \nthat report as a light at the end of a very long COVID pandemic, but \nnow, just a few weeks later, those same officials are defying their own \nexperts, insisting that safe reopening can only happen if Congress \napproves additional funding contained in the Democrats' latest, \nuntargeted spending bill.\n  Students in this country are suffering. They are lonely, they are \nbored, and many of them are struggling with clinical depression and \nanxiety. Teen pregnancy, teen alcohol, and suicide rates are rising. \nChildren need to be in in-person school.\n  The American Academy of Pediatrics has repeatedly stated--bear in \nmind, this isn't something that I am saying; it isn't something that is \npartisan; it is the American Academy of Pediatrics--that it is not only \nfeasible but necessary for students to be back in school, back in the \nclassroom, back to seeing their friends, back to participating in \nextracurricular activities and sports.\n  I would ask my colleagues across the aisle to keep this in mind when \nthey hear from so-called stakeholders who are willing to hold a child's \nmental health hostage in exchange for a political win that will serve \ntheir power and their purposes and not that of the child's. They might \nhave powerful voices in the cable news circuit, but those sound bites \nwill provide you no cover back home with the teachers and \nadministrators who have rolled up their sleeves, have gotten to work, \nand have figured out a way to get schools open for the children.\n  I yield the floor\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Texas.\n\n", "cleaned_text": "Reopening Schools\n\n\tMrs. BLACKBURN. Madam President, I know that some of my colleagues have been talking about schools, getting children back to school, getting schools reopened. Indeed, in Tennessee, that is a topic that has received a good bit of conversation. All but two of our school systems have been open and working this entire school year, and those other two systems have recently reopened since the first of the year. Our school superintendents, our directors of school, our parents, our teachers, and the students have all worked together as a team--a solid, cohesive team--to make this happen.\n\tI think there are two main points that we have seen, and as we are holding meetings with our county elected officials and city officials and as they talk about the efforts that they have made in getting children back into the classroom, we hear a lot about one point. That is that our Governor, Tennessee Governor Bill Lee, made it clear that the school districts would be responsible for the ``how'' they were going to open and the ``when'' they would be reopening. I really thank him for listening and recognizing that local officials and individuals in the community really do know what is best for their school districts and their students.\n\tThe second point is that these plans didn't just drop out of the sky. As I said, this has been a team effort in our communities, and it has happened because there was this agreement between the administrators and the parents and the teachers that they were going to make decisions that were going to be best for the children.

But if all goes \ntheir way, our Democratic colleagues will write a $1.9 trillion check, \nfunded by taxpayers--future taxpayers because it will be borrowed \nmoney--without the input of a single Republican in Congress, either in \nthe House or in the Senate.\n  We know that there are 10 Republicans who went over to the White \nHouse, had a very pleasant meeting with President Biden, but were \nessentially told: My way or the highway. Any effort to try to come up \nwith a bipartisan compromise was rejected\n  Regardless of your political affiliation or views on this particular \nbill, that fact alone should trouble every single American. After all, \nthere was no need for partisan maneuvering to pass a coronavirus relief \nbill last year. As a matter of fact, we passed five of them. All of \nthem were signed into law with overwhelming bipartisan support. No bill \nreceived fewer than 90 votes here in the Senate. One even passed \nunanimously.\n  Of course, the reason for the widespread support wasn't because \nMembers thought these relief packages were perfect. There were things I \nwould have changed if I had had a chance, and I am sure others would \nhave made other changes.\n  But each bill was a clear response to the crisis at hand and free \nfrom any unrelated partisan priorities. In other words, it was focused \non COVID-19 relief.\n  Suffice it to say that the same cannot be said about this latest \npiece of legislation, this $1.9 trillion bill being rammed through \nCongress by our Democratic colleagues.\n  Overall, I have three concerns with this legislation. First, it would \ndramatically overspend in areas that aren't even in need of additional \nfunding.\n  In the early days of the pandemic, we had no real expectation about \nhow long the crisis would last or how big a blow it would deal to our \neconomy. After the CARES Act was signed into law in March, late March, \nit made sense to hit the pause button so we could see how what we did \nwas working--what was working well and what was not working so well. \nWhere was more assistance needed? Where was it sufficient?\n  These needs became obvious pretty quickly. One example was the \nPaycheck Protection Program. Within 2 weeks of passage of $350 billion \nworth of relief, it ran dry--in 2 weeks. So we quickly came together on \na bipartisan basis to replenish the fund with additional money, and we \ndid so again at the end of the year.\n  This sort of bipartisan, step-by-step approach is the most effective \nway to get funding where it is needed without wasting money on already \nwell-funded programs.\n  But, unfortunately, our friends across the aisle didn't apply that \nsame logic to this $1.9 trillion piece of legislation, which sends \nhundreds of billions of dollars to areas that are nowhere near running \nout of money.\n  One example is public education. So far, Congress has provided more \nthan $110 billion to support K-12 education, including $68 billion in \nthe relief bill passed just in December. Schools in Texas have used \nthis money to update their ventilation systems, purchase masks and \npersonal protective equipment, and make other investments in classroom \nsafety. But the vast majority of the funding that was provided in \nDecember is still waiting to be used. In other words, there is no \ncurrent need for any more money from Congress.\n  As a matter of fact, as of February 9, States have spent just under \n$5 billion of the $68 billion we have already provided for K-12 \neducation. They have spent just $5 billion out of the $68 billion.\n  As a reminder, in December, the CDC--the Centers for Disease \nControl--estimated schools would need only about $22 billion to reopen \nsafely, meaning there is already more than enough money to support safe \nschool reopenings. But that data-driven estimate from the experts \ndoesn't seem to matter to our Democratic colleagues or the \nadministration, who are preparing\n\n[[Page S849]]\n\nto drop another $130 billion for public education. So $5 billion has \nbeen spent out of the $68 billion we have already appropriated, and our \nDemocratic colleagues now want to spend another $130 billion.\n  Since most of the existing funds remain to be spent, the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office estimates that the bulk of spending of this \nnew proposed funding would occur after this year, after 2021; that is, \nthe majority of the funding in this new so-called COVID relief bill \nwouldn't even be touched until, God willing, the pandemic is already in \nthe rearview mirror.\n  I have advocated for funding to help our schools prepare for a safe \nreturn to the classroom, and the experts tell us that there is more \nthan sufficient funding already out there to make that happen. So I am \nleft to conclude, as I think most--really, any reasonable person would, \nthat it is irresponsible to have taxpayers foot the bill for another \n$130 billion when there is no need for the funding.\n  And this isn't like we are spending money that we have. We are \nactually borrowing money from future generations, exacerbating an \nalready huge Federal debt.\n  That brings me to the second concern I have with this bill: It \ncompletely ignores the trajectory of our economic recovery.\n  At the start of the pandemic, we all know the economic hammer came \ndown hard and fast. As States imposed lockdown measures, businesses \nclosed their doors, people lost their jobs, and consumer spending \nplummeted.\n  But as the pandemic has gone on, even the more moderate predictions \nabout an economic depression have proven wrong. By any measure, our \neconomy has recovered faster than any of us expected. That should be a \npositive thing. We should be happy about that.\n  The unemployment rate has steadily declined, going from 14.8 percent \nin April to 6.3 percent last month. State tax revenues have largely \nrebounded. As a matter of fact, California has fared so well that it is \nadding money to their rainy day fund. In other words, they don't need \nany more money. Their revenues have exceeded their revenues from years \nbefore the pandemic even hit.\n  The Congressional Budget Office projects that the U.S. economy will \nreturn to its prepandemic size by the middle of this year, even if \nCongress doesn't approve another penny of money. Let me say that again. \nThe Congressional Budget Office projects the U.S. economy will return \nto its prepandemic size in the middle of this year--just a few months \naway--even if Congress does not approve any more Federal money to aid \nthe recovery.\n  Well, it is tough to reconcile that fact with the claim from our \nfriends across the aisle that we need to spend another $1.9 trillion, \nmoney that we don't have.\n  Despite all the data that shows our economy is recovering, rebounding \nin a robust way, this bill sends another $350 billion to State and \nlocal governments that are not facing the dire budget shortfalls that \nwe worried about last March. And it is not without negative \nconsequences.\n  Larry Summers, who served as the Treasury Secretary during the \nClinton administration and who was an economic adviser to President \nObama, offered a good observation on the situation in a recent opinion \npiece. He wrote:\n\n       [W]hereas the Obama stimulus was about half as large as the \n     output shortfall, the proposed Biden stimulus is three times \n     as large as the projected shortfall. Relative to the size of \n     the gap being addressed, it is six times as large.\n\n  For this administration to make public comments about following the \nscience--certainly, following the facts, listening to the experts--it \nis hard to reconcile that with this bill that is so divorced from \nreality. I don't think you can do it, which brings me to my third big \nconcern with this bill: This is not a COVID-19 relief bill in its \nentirety. It includes a range of completely unrelated, liberal \npriorities that should not be included in this emergency spending, let \nalone one that is rushed through in a partisan manner through the \nbudget process.\n  One case in point is the proposed increase in the minimum wage to \n$15. Regardless of the cost of living, businesses in small towns and \nmajor cities alike would be required to pay their employees $15 an hour \nby 2025. Now, for big companies in big cities, that may be doable. That \nmay be the going rate to get the kind of quality workforce you want. As \nwe know, companies like Amazon have already implemented their own $15 \nan hour minimum wage back in 2018, and they can afford it. But for \nsmall businesses that are the backbone of our economy and are key to \nour economic recovery following this pandemic, this could lead to \nmassive layoffs or permanent closures.\n  The Congressional Budget Office that I referred to earlier estimates \nthat this provision alone could put 1.4 million Americans out of work. \nDo we really want to pass a provision that would put 1.4 million \nAmericans out of work? That is 50 percent more than it could \npotentially lift out of poverty.\n  As a reminder, our colleagues are trying to rush this massive change \nthrough Congress as part of a pandemic relief bill because they know \nthat it is the only shot at passing a bill that would have this sort of \ndramatic negative effect on jobs--all under the guise of economic \nrelief and stimulus. There is simply no way to justify a one-size-fits-\nall mandate that treats Silicon Valley the same as it does mom-and-pop \nbusinesses in rural America.\n  And the range of unrelated provisions doesn't stop there. This \nlegislation includes $30 billion for public transit agencies, a blank \ncheck to bail out mismanaged union pension funds without any reforms, \nand funding for a bridge to connect the majority leader's home State of \nNew York to Canada. So we are going to build the majority leader a \nbridge to Canada as part of an emergency COVID-19 relief bill. It is \noutrageous. Everyone remembers the infamous earmark now known as the \nbridge to nowhere. At least in this case we know where the bridge will \nend up. But a pandemic relief bill should not serve as a Trojan horse \nin order to pursue such parochial and local desires or any other part \nof an unrelated liberal wish list.\n  So the Biden bill of $1.9 trillion actually creates more problems \nthan it solves or it tries to solve nonexistent problems. It drives up \nour national debt by spending money that experts say is not needed. It \nignores the data--the facts about our economic recovery--and it creates \neven more problems, all in the name of securing a win for the \nadministration and our Democratic colleagues.

The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "Coronavirus\n\n\tMadam President, on another matter, as you know, this week our Democratic colleagues in the House are continuing to take action on President Biden's relief bill, using the budget reconciliation process.\n\tIt is really not so much an issue in the House, where you can do anything you want, basically, with a majority vote. But if all goes their way, our Democratic colleagues will write a $1.9 trillion check, funded by taxpayers--future taxpayers because it will be borrowed money--without the input of a single Republican in Congress, either in the House or in the Senate.\n\tWe know that there are 10 Republicans who went over to the White House, had a very pleasant meeting with President Biden, but were essentially told: My way or the highway. Any effort to try to come up with a bipartisan compromise was rejected\n\tRegardless of your political affiliation or views on this particular bill, that fact alone should trouble every single American. After all, there was no need for partisan maneuvering to pass a coronavirus relief bill last year. As a matter of fact, we passed five of them. All of them were signed into law with overwhelming bipartisan support. No bill received fewer than 90 votes here in the Senate. One even passed unanimously.\n\tOf course, the reason for the widespread support wasn't because Members thought these relief packages were perfect. There were things I would have changed if I had had a chance, and I am sure others would have made other changes.\n\tBut each bill was a clear response to the crisis at hand and free from any unrelated partisan priorities. In other words, it was focused on COVID-19 relief.\n\tSuffice it to say that the same cannot be said about this latest piece of legislation, this $1.9 trillion bill being rammed through Congress by our Democratic colleagues.\n\tOverall, I have three concerns with this legislation. First, it would dramatically overspend in areas that aren't even in need of additional funding.\n\tIn the early days of the pandemic, we had no real expectation about how long the crisis would last or how big a blow it would deal to our economy. After the CARES Act was signed into law in March, late March, it made sense to hit the pause button so we could see how what we did was working--what was working well and what was not working so well. Where was more assistance needed? Where was it sufficient?\n\tThese needs became obvious pretty quickly. One example was the Paycheck Protection Program. Within 2 weeks of passage of $350 billion worth of relief, it ran dry--in 2 weeks. So we quickly came together on a bipartisan basis to replenish the fund with additional money, and we did so again at the end of the year.\n\tThis sort of bipartisan, step-by-step approach is the most effective way to get funding where it is needed without wasting money on already well-funded programs.\n\tBut, unfortunately, our friends across the aisle didn't apply that same logic to this $1.9 trillion piece of legislation, which sends hundreds of billions of dollars to areas that are nowhere near running out of money.\n\tOne example is public education. So far, Congress has provided more than $110 billion to support K-12 education, including $68 billion in the relief bill passed just in December. Schools in Texas have used this money to update their ventilation systems, purchase masks and personal protective equipment, and make other investments in classroom safety. But the vast majority of the funding that was provided in December is still waiting to be used. In other words, there is no current need for any more money from Congress.\n\tAs a matter of fact, as of February 9, States have spent just under $5 billion of the $68 billion we have already provided for K-12 education. They have spent just $5 billion out of the $68 billion.\n\tAs a reminder, in December, the CDC--the Centers for Disease Control--estimated schools would need only about $22 billion to reopen safely, meaning there is already more than enough money to support safe school reopenings. But that data-driven estimate from the experts doesn't seem to matter to our Democratic colleagues or the administration, who are preparing to drop another $130 billion for public education. So $5 billion has been spent out of the $68 billion we have already appropriated, and our Democratic colleagues now want to spend another $130 billion.\n\tSince most of the existing funds remain to be spent, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bulk of spending of this new proposed funding would occur after this year, after 2021; that is, the majority of the funding in this new so-called COVID relief bill wouldn't even be touched until, God willing, the pandemic is already in the rearview mirror.\n\tI have advocated for funding to help our schools prepare for a safe return to the classroom, and the experts tell us that there is more than sufficient funding already out there to make that happen. So I am left to conclude, as I think most--really, any reasonable person would, that it is irresponsible to have taxpayers foot the bill for another $130 billion when there is no need for the funding.\n\tAnd this isn't like we are spending money that we have. We are actually borrowing money from future generations, exacerbating an already huge Federal debt.\n\tThat brings me to the second concern I have with this bill: It completely ignores the trajectory of our economic recovery.\n\tAt the start of the pandemic, we all know the economic hammer came down hard and fast. As States imposed lockdown measures, businesses closed their doors, people lost their jobs, and consumer spending plummeted.\n\tBut as the pandemic has gone on, even the more moderate predictions about an economic depression have proven wrong. By any measure, our economy has recovered faster than any of us expected. That should be a positive thing. We should be happy about that.\n\tThe unemployment rate has steadily declined, going from 14.8 percent in April to 6.3 percent last month. State tax revenues have largely rebounded. As a matter of fact, California has fared so well that it is adding money to their rainy day fund. In other words, they don't need any more money. Their revenues have exceeded their revenues from years before the pandemic even hit.\n\tThe Congressional Budget Office projects that the U.S. economy will return to its prepandemic size by the middle of this year, even if Congress doesn't approve another penny of money. Let me say that again. The Congressional Budget Office projects the U.S. economy will return to its prepandemic size in the middle of this year--just a few months away--even if Congress does not approve any more Federal money to aid the recovery.\n\tWell, it is tough to reconcile that fact with the claim from our friends across the aisle that we need to spend another $1.9 trillion, money that we don't have.\n\tDespite all the data that shows our economy is recovering, rebounding in a robust way, this bill sends another $350 billion to State and local governments that are not facing the dire budget shortfalls that we worried about last March. And it is not without negative consequences.\n\tLarry Summers, who served as the Treasury Secretary during the Clinton administration and who was an economic adviser to President Obama, offered a good observation on the situation in a recent opinion piece. He wrote:\n\n       [W]hereas the Obama stimulus was about half as large as the \n     output shortfall, the proposed Biden stimulus is three times \n     as large as the projected shortfall. Relative to the size of \n     the gap being addressed, it is six times as large.\n\n\tFor this administration to make public comments about following the science--certainly, following the facts, listening to the experts--it is hard to reconcile that with this bill that is so divorced from reality. I don't think you can do it, which brings me to my third big concern with this bill: This is not a COVID-19 relief bill in its entirety. It includes a range of completely unrelated, liberal priorities that should not be included in this emergency spending, let alone one that is rushed through in a partisan manner through the budget process.\n\tOne case in point is the proposed increase in the minimum wage to $15. Regardless of the cost of living, businesses in small towns and major cities alike would be required to pay their employees $15 an hour by 2025. Now, for big companies in big cities, that may be doable. That may be the going rate to get the kind of quality workforce you want. As we know, companies like Amazon have already implemented their own $15 an hour minimum wage back in 2018, and they can afford it. But for small businesses that are the backbone of our economy and are key to our economic recovery following this pandemic, this could lead to massive layoffs or permanent closures.\n\tThe Congressional Budget Office that I referred to earlier estimates that this provision alone could put 1.4 million Americans out of work. Do we really want to pass a provision that would put 1.4 million Americans out of work? That is 50 percent more than it could potentially lift out of poverty.\n\tAs a reminder, our colleagues are trying to rush this massive change through Congress as part of a pandemic relief bill because they know that it is the only shot at passing a bill that would have this sort of dramatic negative effect on jobs--all under the guise of economic relief and stimulus. There is simply no way to justify a one-size-fits-all mandate that treats Silicon Valley the same as it does mom-and-pop businesses in rural America.\n\tAnd the range of unrelated provisions doesn't stop there. This legislation includes $30 billion for public transit agencies, a blank check to bail out mismanaged union pension funds without any reforms, and funding for a bridge to connect the majority leader's home State of New York to Canada. So we are going to build the majority leader a bridge to Canada as part of an emergency COVID-19 relief bill. It is outrageous. Everyone remembers the infamous earmark now known as the bridge to nowhere. At least in this case we know where the bridge will end up. But a pandemic relief bill should not serve as a Trojan horse in order to pursue such parochial and local desires or any other part of an unrelated liberal wish list.\n\tSo the Biden bill of $1.9 trillion actually creates more problems than it solves or it tries to solve nonexistent problems. It drives up our national debt by spending money that experts say is not needed. It ignores the data--the facts about our economic recovery--and it creates even more problems, all in the name of securing a win for the administration and our Democratic colleagues. It is as though this bill were drafted in a vacuum with no attention paid to what has already been done, how things are going, or what we anticipate the need will be in the future.\n\tIf the evidence and the experts tell us that more funding is needed to bolster our response to the virus, I will be one of the first people to advocate for additional targeted relief. But this race to spend money for the sake of spending money and ignore what the experts are saying is absolutely disgraceful.\n\tThe two parties have done much better than this. As I said, last year, we passed five COVID relief bills on a bipartisan basis because we all were trying to come together and meet a common enemy--the COVID-19 virus and the consequences of the pandemic. But it seems like this $1.9 trillion wish list is divorced, really, from the COVID-19 relief that we did in the past and is designed purely for partisan political purposes, and I think it is an unfortunate development in an area where we have so successfully worked together in a bipartisan way.\n\tI yield the floor.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ossoff).

Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern about \nincreasing insecurity in the Darfur region of Sudan and to call for \nimmediate action to prevent further violence and protect civilians.\n  As many of my colleagues will recall, in 2003 the regime of toppled \nSudanese dictator Omar al-Bashir began a vicious and deadly campaign \nagainst his own citizens in the Darfur region. Millions were driven \nfrom their homes, and hundreds of thousands killed and sometimes raped \nby militia armed and supported by the government. In 2004 Congress and \nthe State Department stood united in determining that what was taking \nplace in Darfur was, in fact, genocide. Three years after that \ndetermination, the United Nations-African Union Hybrid Operation in \nDarfur, UNAMID, was established.\n  UNAMID has not been perfect. However, despite numerous obstacles the \nGovernment of Sudan put in place under al-Bashir to obstruct the \nmission's ability to carry out its mandate to protect civilians, UNAMID \nhas provided critical support for the people of Darfur. UNAMID \npolicewomen have served as trusted confidants for Darfuri women to \nreport sexual and domestic violence, and UNAMID soldiers have provided \na protective presence, deterring violence against civilians in areas \nwhere they have been deployed. Overall, the presence of international \nforces has reinforced some sense of security and stability for the \nhundreds of thousands of people in Darfur who remain displaced, so that \nthat they can continue to live full and dignified lives. These efforts \nhave come at significant cost both in blood and treasure: 64 UNAMID \npeacekeepers have been killed, and billions of dollars spent, in \nsupport of the mission.\n  With the fall of Bashir, many had hoped that the situation in Darfur \nwould improve. However, those hopes have yet to be fully realized. \nViolence in West Darfur in late December of 2019 killed dozens and \ndisplaced an estimated 40,000 people. In January 2020, two separate \nviolent incidents in North Darfur were additional indicators that all \nwas not well in the region, as were deadly attacks on internally \ndisplaced camps in July. In January of this year, communal clashes in \nWest and South Darfur resulted in the death of over 250 people and the \ndisplacement of over 100,000. These episodes raise the specter of a \nreturn to the catastrophic and genocidal violence that engulfed the \nregion in 2003. But instead of redoubling its commitment to Darfur's \nlong-suffering people at this critical time, the international \ncommunity risks abandoning them.\n  This past December, the United Nations Security Council made the \ndecision to dissolve UNAMID. Although it will retain a presence in the \nregion until it completes its full drawdown at the end of June 2021, \nUNAMID's core civilian protection functions have now ceased. UNAMID is \nto be replaced by the United Nations Integrated Transition Assistance \nMission in Sudan, or UNITAMS. UNITAMS is a Sudan-wide political mission \nthat is aimed at assisting with the transition. I agree that such a \nmission is needed to ensure that Sudan's transition to democracy is \nsuccessful. However, supporting the transition and protecting \nvulnerable civilians are not mutually exclusive, and the mandate for \nUNITAMS could have included both. Unfortunately, Sudan's transitional \ngovernment refused to accept this course of action, and\n\n[[Page S852]]\n\nUNITAMS therefore lacks UNAMID's Chapter VII authorities to deploy \nmilitary tools in service of civilian protection and the advancement of \npeace in Darfur. Officials in the transitional government at the \nhighest levels have argued that a Chapter VII mission is not necessary \nbecause the security situation in Darfur has improved; that many of the \nwarring parties in Darfur have made peace with the Government of Sudan \nthrough the Juba Peace Agreement; that Bashir's genocidal regime, which \nbore primary responsibility for the crisis in the region, is no longer \nin power; and that the transitional government is implementing a \nsecurity plan for Darfur that will adequately protect civilians.\n  I do not share this assessment of the situation in Darfur, and recent \nclashes, as well earlier rounds of violence that have plagued Darfur \nsince Sudan's transition began in 2019, demonstrate that the region \nremains fragile. Communal tensions over land, water, and political \npower persist, and Darfur is awash in weapons. The government's program \nto provide security to the region, including through its National Plan \nfor Civilian Protection, has yet to be adequately fleshed out let alone \nimplemented. Just last week, the UNAMID team site at Saraf Umrah that \nwas transferred to the Sudanese Government on January 21 was looted by \nunnamed assailants, and all of the buildings on the site were \nreportedly destroyed despite the government's prior commitment to \nsecure it. The Juba Peace Agreement, while promising, has not been \nendorsed by all of Darfur's warring parties. And most worryingly, those \nlikely to be charged with protecting civilians in Darfur, including \ncomponents of the Sudanese military and the Rapid Support Forces, RSF, \nof Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, are the same actors that for years worked to \nimplement Bashir's campaign of terror and genocide in the region.\n  In this context, the United Nations Security Council's ill-timed and \npoorly-conceived decision to end UNAMID's mandate--facilitated by the \nTrump administration's lack of a well-thought-out diplomatic strategy \nand approach--and to rapidly draw down the mission exposes the Darfuri \npeople to significant harm. It could derail Sudan's civilian-led \ntransition to democracy, resulting in another round of instability that \nSudan and the broader region can ill afford. That is why in February \n2020 I led a group of Senators in writing to the Trump administration, \nurging it to ensure that the U.N. maintain a mission in Darfur with an \nadequate number of peacekeeping troops operating under a robust Chapter \nVII mandate to protect civilians from violence; and that is why I am \nraising the alarm again here today. The United States, along with its \ninternational partners, must work rapidly to put in place mechanisms \nthat can protect Darfur's civilians until such a time that Sudan's \ntransitional government is capable of providing security to the region.\n  Fortunately, the plight of Darfur has long attracted the bipartisan \nsupport of Congress and multiple administrations. At this critical \ntime, it is vital that our commitment remain steadfast. I hope to work \nwith the Biden administration to urgently address the security vacuum \ncreated by UNAMID's drawdown and call upon Secretary of State Blinken \nand United Nations Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield to take urgent steps.\n  First, we must use our voice and vote at the UNSC to encourage a \ntemporary reauthorization of UNAMID so that it can carry out critical \nprotection of civilian functions, at the very least until it fully \ndraws down in June 2021. Second, we must work actively at the UNSC to \nstrengthen the mandate of the UNITAMS so that it includes robust \ncivilian protection mechanisms. Third, we should press Sudan's \ncivilian-led transitional government to develop a credible civilian \nprotection plan in Darfur that does not--I repeat, does not--involve \nthe RSF or any other forces implicated in violence in Darfur. Fourth, \nthe administration should carefully monitor progress on civilian \nprotection in Darfur and provide support where necessary, including by \nconsidering how much of the recently appropriated $700 million for \nSudan needs to be set aside to support civilian security in Darfur. \nFifth, we must make clear to all that sustainable peace in Darfur \nrequires justice and accountability for past atrocities, no matter how \npowerful the people implicated.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support a closer bilateral relationship \nwith Sudan and will continue, as I have for the past 2 years, to do \nwhat I can to ensure the United States does its part to see to it that \nSudan's civilian-led transition to democracy is successful. We have \nwhat may be a once in a generation opportunity. A healthy political \ntransition at the national level will only aid the cause of peace in \nDarfur, and vice versa.\n  Mr. President, the situation in Darfur requires our urgent and \nconsidered attention. Let us continue our strong tradition of \nbipartisan support for the long-suffering people of Sudan at this \ncritical time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "DARFUR\n\n\tMr. MENENDEZ.

Three years after that determination, the United Nations-African Union Hybrid Operation in Darfur, UNAMID, was established.\n\tUNAMID has not been perfect. However, despite numerous obstacles the Government of Sudan put in place under al-Bashir to obstruct the mission's ability to carry out its mandate to protect civilians, UNAMID has provided critical support for the people of Darfur. UNAMID policewomen have served as trusted confidants for Darfuri women to report sexual and domestic violence, and UNAMID soldiers have provided a protective presence, deterring violence against civilians in areas where they have been deployed. Overall, the presence of international forces has reinforced some sense of security and stability for the hundreds of thousands of people in Darfur who remain displaced, so that that they can continue to live full and dignified lives. These efforts have come at significant cost both in blood and treasure: 64 UNAMID peacekeepers have been killed, and billions of dollars spent, in support of the mission.\n\tWith the fall of Bashir, many had hoped that the situation in Darfur would improve. However, those hopes have yet to be fully realized. Violence in West Darfur in late December of 2019 killed dozens and displaced an estimated 40,000 people. In January 2020, two separate violent incidents in North Darfur were additional indicators that all was not well in the region, as were deadly attacks on internally displaced camps in July. In January of this year, communal clashes in West and South Darfur resulted in the death of over 250 people and the displacement of over 100,000. These episodes raise the specter of a return to the catastrophic and genocidal violence that engulfed the region in 2003. But instead of redoubling its commitment to Darfur's long-suffering people at this critical time, the international community risks abandoning them.\n\tThis past December, the United Nations Security Council made the decision to dissolve UNAMID. Although it will retain a presence in the region until it completes its full drawdown at the end of June 2021, UNAMID's core civilian protection functions have now ceased. UNAMID is to be replaced by the United Nations Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in Sudan, or UNITAMS. UNITAMS is a Sudan-wide political mission that is aimed at assisting with the transition. I agree that such a mission is needed to ensure that Sudan's transition to democracy is successful. However, supporting the transition and protecting vulnerable civilians are not mutually exclusive, and the mandate for UNITAMS could have included both. Unfortunately, Sudan's transitional government refused to accept this course of action, and UNITAMS therefore lacks UNAMID's Chapter VII authorities to deploy military tools in service of civilian protection and the advancement of peace in Darfur. Officials in the transitional government at the highest levels have argued that a Chapter VII mission is not necessary because the security situation in Darfur has improved; that many of the warring parties in Darfur have made peace with the Government of Sudan through the Juba Peace Agreement; that Bashir's genocidal regime, which bore primary responsibility for the crisis in the region, is no longer in power; and that the transitional government is implementing a security plan for Darfur that will adequately protect civilians.\n\tI do not share this assessment of the situation in Darfur, and recent clashes, as well earlier rounds of violence that have plagued Darfur since Sudan's transition began in 2019, demonstrate that the region remains fragile. Communal tensions over land, water, and political power persist, and Darfur is awash in weapons. The government's program to provide security to the region, including through its National Plan for Civilian Protection, has yet to be adequately fleshed out let alone implemented. Just last week, the UNAMID team site at Saraf Umrah that was transferred to the Sudanese Government on January 21 was looted by unnamed assailants, and all of the buildings on the site were reportedly destroyed despite the government's prior commitment to secure it. The Juba Peace Agreement, while promising, has not been endorsed by all of Darfur's warring parties. And most worryingly, those likely to be charged with protecting civilians in Darfur, including components of the Sudanese military and the Rapid Support Forces, RSF, of Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, are the same actors that for years worked to implement Bashir's campaign of terror and genocide in the region.\n\tIn this context, the United Nations Security Council's ill-timed and poorly-conceived decision to end UNAMID's mandate--facilitated by the Trump administration's lack of a well-thought-out diplomatic strategy and approach--and to rapidly draw down the mission exposes the Darfuri people to significant harm. It could derail Sudan's civilian-led transition to democracy, resulting in another round of instability that Sudan and the broader region can ill afford. That is why in February 2020 I led a group of Senators in writing to the Trump administration, urging it to ensure that the U.N. maintain a mission in Darfur with an adequate number of peacekeeping troops operating under a robust Chapter VII mandate to protect civilians from violence; and that is why I am raising the alarm again here today. The United States, along with its international partners, must work rapidly to put in place mechanisms that can protect Darfur's civilians until such a time that Sudan's transitional government is capable of providing security to the region.\n\tFortunately, the plight of Darfur has long attracted the bipartisan support of Congress and multiple administrations. At this critical time, it is vital that our commitment remain steadfast. I hope to work with the Biden administration to urgently address the security vacuum created by UNAMID's drawdown and call upon Secretary of State Blinken and United Nations Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield to take urgent steps.\n\tFirst, we must use our voice and vote at the UNSC to encourage a temporary reauthorization of UNAMID so that it can carry out critical protection of civilian functions, at the very least until it fully draws down in June 2021. Second, we must work actively at the UNSC to strengthen the mandate of the UNITAMS so that it includes robust civilian protection mechanisms. Third, we should press Sudan's civilian-led transitional government to develop a credible civilian protection plan in Darfur that does not--I repeat, does not--involve the RSF or any other forces implicated in violence in Darfur. Fourth, the administration should carefully monitor progress on civilian protection in Darfur and provide support where necessary, including by considering how much of the recently appropriated $700 million for Sudan needs to be set aside to support civilian security in Darfur. Fifth, we must make clear to all that sustainable peace in Darfur requires justice and accountability for past atrocities, no matter how powerful the people implicated.\n\tMr. President, I strongly support a closer bilateral relationship with Sudan and will continue, as I have for the past 2 years, to do what I can to ensure the United States does its part to see to it that Sudan's civilian-led transition to democracy is successful. We have what may be a once in a generation opportunity. A healthy political transition at the national level will only aid the cause of peace in Darfur, and vice versa.\n\tMr. President, the situation in Darfur requires our urgent and considered attention. Let us continue our strong tradition of bipartisan support for the long-suffering people of Sudan at this critical time.\n\n                          ____________________", "speakers": ["Robert Menendez"], "citation": "167 Cong.

This is not \na responsibility I sought or expected. I certainly did not anticipate \nhaving to serve a second time as a Senator-juror in an impeachment \ntrial.\n  An initial question shaping the context of this trial was whether or \nnot the Senate has constitutional jurisdiction to try a President who \nis no longer in office. The Constitution gives the Senate the power to \ntry all impeachments. In this case, where the House impeached the \nPresident while he was in office, it is particularly clear that the \nimpeachment is constitutional and therefore that this trial is \nconstitutional. The weight of legal opinion and historical precedent \naffirms this conclusion. Further, the Senate decided this question in \nthe affirmative. I believe its decision was correct: The Senate must \nnot surrender its power to hold accountable those who abuse their \noffice or threaten our Republic, even in their final days in office.\n  In following the oath in an impeachment trial and in our \ndeliberations on the final question, I believe it is up to every \nSenator to determine what to consider and what the Constitution and \ntheir conscience require of them. The conclusion I reached on the final \nverdict will not surprise anyone who read my reasoning in the first \nimpeachment trial: I consider an attempt to corrupt an election to keep \noneself in power one of the most reprehensible acts that can be taken \nby a sitting President. The second impeachment resulted from the \nPresident's continued effort to do just that.\n  His attempt to pressure Georgia's secretary of state to falsify the \nelectoral results was itself a heinous act that merited impeachment. \nPresident Trump summoned his supporters to Washington on the very day \nof the electoral vote count, knowing that among the people he gathered \nwere many who had committed violence in the past and who had violent \nintent. Despite the obvious and well-known threat of violence, he \nincited and directed thousands to descend upon the seat of Congress as \nit was undertaking the constitutionally prescribed process to certify \nhis successor.

Some anticipate social unrest and violence. A few \neven predict civil war. Still others fear that a weakened America will \nbecome vulnerable to an opportunistic foreign foe.\n  We instinctively know that the growing division represents a growing \ndanger. Academics and pundits may promote cures, but in our hearts, we \nknow that their bromides won't heal the rift. People aren't going to \nreturn to mainstream media, churches aren't going to experience a \nresurgence, and income inequality will remain a persistent feature of \nthe global digital economy.\n  Throughout history, only one thing has been able to unite a divided \nnation: great leaders--leaders like Churchill who inspired a fearful \nnation; leaders like Lincoln who mustered the national will to save the \nUnion; and leaders like Reagan who raised our spirits from suffocating \nmalaise. Leaders like these also have been essential in our churches \nand universities and businesses and charities, and just as importantly, \nin our homes.\n  With our Nation so divided, so vulnerable to economic distress or to \ncivil violence or even to foreign adversaries, the need for leadership \nthat unites and uplifts, that calls on our better angels, is as great \nas we have ever known.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor a lifelong \nleader of West Michigan's economic development community, Birgit Klohs, \npresident and CEO of The Right Place in Grand Rapids, MI. Ms. Klohs has \nmade an immense impact on western Michigan over the past 33 years and \nhas helped reshape the region and State's future.\n  Born in West Germany, Ms. Klohs left her home country to attend \nWestern Michigan University in Kalamazoo, where she graduated with a \nbachelors of business administration in finance. While going to school \nfull time, she began her economic development career in service to the \nBerrien County Economic Development Corporation as an industrial \nconsultant and then eventually moved to the Michigan Department of \nCommerce where she served as an account executive focusing on western \nMichigan.\n  Later, as assistant director of the Office for Economic Expansion at \nGrand Valley State University, Ms. Klohs was asked to join the region's \nfirst-ever European foreign investment mission in conjunction with The \nRight Place. The Right Place, an organization started in 1985 by Grand \nRapids area business executives, was concerned that the region was \nmissing out on economic opportunities. That trip involved discussions \nwith a German company that 2 years later broke ground on a new \nmanufacturing plant just north of Grand Rapids, a highlight in Klohs' \ncareer dedicated to keeping and growing jobs in the region.\n  Mrs. Klohs applied for the directorship of The Right Place and began \nleading the organization as president and CEO in 1987. At that time, \nThe Right Place had a small staff serving one county; after Ms. Klohs' \ndynamic leadership and expertise, it grew into a\n\n[[Page S854]]\n\nteam of more than 30 professionals serving a six-county region. \nThroughout her three decades of leadership, The Right Place has \nassisted thousands of west Michigan companies to invest more than $5 \nbillion and create 48,500 new jobs throughout the region.\n  Ms. Klohs also helped the region, known for its manufacturing \nheritage, to grow its skill and sophistication in making things, from \nmedical devices to office furniture. In the process, she helped the \nregion grow and increase the job opportunities across many sectors. \nThose efforts attracted attention worldwide, with ``The Economist'' \nlast year citing Grand Rapids as ``the most successful intensive \nmanufacturing city in America'' and Forbes ranking Grand Rapids No. 2 \non its list of the top 15 industrial cities in America.\n  Over her career, Ms. Klohs worked closely with five Michigan \nGovernors to pursue economic development opportunities around the \nglobe. The region is now home to 136 foreign companies, including more \nthan 50 from her homeland of Germany. She is credited with fostering \ncountless public-private ventures that advance the economic prosperity \nof the region, including the Medical Mile which is the 10th largest \nlife science cluster in the United States, the Michigan Manufacturing \nTechnology Center West, and partnerships with Hello West Michigan, the \nfirst employer-driven relocation and job information center in the \nNation.\n  Most recently, The Right Place recognized that economic prosperity \nwas not being shared by all citizens. That led to the creation of a New \nCommunity Transformation Fund to uplift communities of color through \ncapital investment. As the pandemic reared its ugly head throughout \n2020, The Right Place quickly pivoted to assist in delivering $10 \nmillion in emergency financial aid to 1200 struggling businesses in the \nGrand Rapids community and harnessed the region's manufacturing \ningenuity and supply chains to create and distribute lifesaving \npersonal protective equipment.\n  Ms. Klohs' commitment to the region and State was not limited to The \nRight Place.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor a lifelong leader of West Michigan's economic development community, Birgit Klohs, president and CEO of The Right Place in Grand Rapids, MI. Ms. Klohs has made an immense impact on western Michigan over the past 33 years and has helped reshape the region and State's future.\n\tBorn in West Germany, Ms. Klohs left her home country to attend Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo, where she graduated with a bachelors of business administration in finance. While going to school full time, she began her economic development career in service to the Berrien County Economic Development Corporation as an industrial consultant and then eventually moved to the Michigan Department of Commerce where she served as an account executive focusing on western Michigan.\n\tLater, as assistant director of the Office for Economic Expansion at Grand Valley State University, Ms. Klohs was asked to join the region's first-ever European foreign investment mission in conjunction with The Right Place. The Right Place, an organization started in 1985 by Grand Rapids area business executives, was concerned that the region was missing out on economic opportunities. That trip involved discussions with a German company that 2 years later broke ground on a new manufacturing plant just north of Grand Rapids, a highlight in Klohs' career dedicated to keeping and growing jobs in the region.\n\tMrs. Klohs applied for the directorship of The Right Place and began leading the organization as president and CEO in 1987. At that time, The Right Place had a small staff serving one county; after Ms. Klohs' dynamic leadership and expertise, it grew into a team of more than 30 professionals serving a six-county region. Throughout her three decades of leadership, The Right Place has assisted thousands of west Michigan companies to invest more than $5 billion and create 48,500 new jobs throughout the region.\n\tMs. Klohs also helped the region, known for its manufacturing heritage, to grow its skill and sophistication in making things, from medical devices to office furniture. In the process, she helped the region grow and increase the job opportunities across many sectors. Those efforts attracted attention worldwide, with ``The Economist'' last year citing Grand Rapids as ``the most successful intensive manufacturing city in America'' and Forbes ranking Grand Rapids No. 2 on its list of the top 15 industrial cities in America.\n\tOver her career, Ms. Klohs worked closely with five Michigan Governors to pursue economic development opportunities around the globe. The region is now home to 136 foreign companies, including more than 50 from her homeland of Germany. She is credited with fostering countless public-private ventures that advance the economic prosperity of the region, including the Medical Mile which is the 10th largest life science cluster in the United States, the Michigan Manufacturing Technology Center West, and partnerships with Hello West Michigan, the first employer-driven relocation and job information center in the Nation.\n\tMost recently, The Right Place recognized that economic prosperity was not being shared by all citizens. That led to the creation of a New Community Transformation Fund to uplift communities of color through capital investment. As the pandemic reared its ugly head throughout 2020, The Right Place quickly pivoted to assist in delivering $10 million in emergency financial aid to 1200 struggling businesses in the Grand Rapids community and harnessed the region's manufacturing ingenuity and supply chains to create and distribute lifesaving personal protective equipment.\n\tMs. Klohs' commitment to the region and State was not limited to The Right Place. Among the boards she chaired or served on are the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, the Gerald R. Ford Airport Authority, the International Crossing Authority, and the Western Michigan University Board of Trustees, her alma mater.\n\tMs. Birgit Klohs was fond of saying that economic development was ``a team sport.'' After 33 years as captain of one of the Nation's most successful teams, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in congratulating her for her well-earned retirement from The Right Place and to wish Birgit and her family health and happiness in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________", "speakers": ["Gary C.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mr. \nStephen Bates, who was Vermont's first Black sheriff and chief of \npolice. Mr. Bates was elected sheriff and chief of police of Vergennes, \nVT, in 1879, where he served as a public official until his death in \n1907.\n  Mr. Bates faced many obstacles on his journey to his elected \npositions in Vergennes. Born in Shirley, VA, in 1842, historical \nrecords show that he and his family members were enslaved on the \nShirley plantation. In August of 1862, Mr. Bates successfully escape \nfrom the Shirley plantation. Several months prior to the Emancipation \nAct of 1863, Mr. Bates courageously helped many other enslaved people \nescape to freedom.\n  After the Civil War, when Mr. Bates was in the service of officers at \nHarrison's Landing, Mr. Bates was employed by U.S. Representative \nFrederick E. Woodbridge, of Vergennes, VT. Mr. Bates worked as \nCongressman Woodbridge's coachman and moved with him to Vergennes in \n1866. In 1871, Mr. Bates married Frances Mason of Elizabethtown, NY, \nand had two children, Rose and Fredrick. The Bates family lived on \nNorth Street in Vergennes until 1880, when their home was destroyed by \na fire. The residents of Vergennes showed much support to the family \nfollowing the fire, rallying to raise money to help them during that \ndifficult time.\n  During his time as chief of police, Mr. Bates was responsible for \nsome notable arrests, including ``Brooklyn Slim'' and ``Ottawa Red,'' \ntwo members of a gang of post office burglars. He also had in his \ncustody Oliver Curtis Perry, an infamous New York train robber of the \ntime. Newspaper articles describe Mr. Bates as the arresting officer in \nmurder, grand larceny, check forgery, and vagrancy cases in Vergennes \nand the surrounding area. In 1897, Mr. Bates was awarded $100 by the \nAssistant Attorney General of the Post Office Department for his \nextraordinary work in arresting two people involved with robbing post \noffices in Morrisville, Glover, and Windsor, VT, in 1894.\n  Though Mr. Bates dedicated his life to his community, he still faced \nmany challenges as the first Black sheriff in Vermont. During one \nincident, a man tried to kill Sheriff Bates while he was responding to \na call. And while the man was charged with attempted murder, he was \nfound guilty of obstructing, beating, and wounding an officer. \nVergennes community members stated that Mr. Bates ``was almost entirely \na self-taught man, and in the discharge of the duties of his office was \ncool and self-restrained, rarely if ever acting hastily.'' Despite \nthis, Mr. Bates was not well-compensated for his work and was required \nto work a number of other jobs to provide for his family. As he was \nskilled at handling and caring for horses, he managed a horse company \nowned by Congressman Woodbridge's son. He also worked as a trusted \nnight watchman at a local bank, as well as a custodian. Uniquely \ndedicated to his community despite the hardship he faced, Mr. Bates \nalso served as an appointed agent for the Humane Society, and he and \nhis family were active members of St. Paul's Episcopal Church in \nVergennes. Mr. Bates died from cardiac arrest while milking a cow on \nJune 10, 1907.\n  I am proud to honor the life and work of Mr. Stephen Bates. Though he \nremains relatively unknown by many Vermonters, it is encouraging to \nknow that Vergennes and its residents came together not long after the \nend of the Civil War to elect Vermont's first Black sheriff and chief \nof police, who was an exemplary public servant and community leader. It \nis a remarkable American story that I am glad to honor and celebrate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "REMEMBERING SHERRIFF STEPHEN BATES\n\tMr. SANDERS.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 411\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Mothers and Offspring \n     Mortality and Morbidity Awareness Act'' or the ``MOMMA's \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Every year, across the United States, nearly 4,000,000 \n     women give birth, about 700 women suffer fatal complications \n     during pregnancy, while giving birth or during the postpartum \n     period, and about 70,000 women suffer near-fatal, partum-\n     related complications.\n       (2) The maternal mortality rate is often used as a proxy to \n     measure the overall health of a population. While the infant \n     mortality rate in the United States has reached its lowest \n     point, the risk of death for women in the United States \n     during pregnancy, childbirth, or the postpartum period is \n     higher than such risk in many other high-income countries. \n     The estimated maternal mortality rate (deaths per 100,000 \n     live births) for the 48 contiguous States and Washington, \n     D.C. increased from 14.5 percent in 2000 to 17.3 in 2017. The \n     United States is the only industrialized nation with a rising \n     maternal mortality rate.\n       (3) The National Vital Statistics System of the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention has found that in 2018, there \n     were 17.4 maternal deaths for every 100,000 live births in \n     the United States. This ratio is more than double that of \n     most other high-income countries.\n       (4) It is estimated that more than 60 percent of maternal \n     deaths in the United States are preventable.\n       (5) According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, the maternal mortality rate varies drastically \n     for women by race and ethnicity. There are about 13 deaths \n     per 100,000 live births for White women, 40.8 deaths per \n     100,000 live births for non-Hispanic Black women, and 29.7 \n     deaths per 100,000 live births for American Indian/Alaskan \n     Native women. While maternal mortality disparately impacts \n     Black women, this urgent public health crisis traverses race, \n     ethnicity, socioeconomic status, educational background, and \n     geography.\n       (6) In the United States, non-Hispanic Black women are \n     about 3 times more likely to die from causes related to \n     pregnancy and childbirth compared to non-Hispanic White \n     women, which is one of the most disconcerting racial \n     disparities in public health. This disparity widens in \n     certain cities and States across the country.\n       (7) According to the National Center for Health Statistics \n     of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the \n     maternal mortality rate heightens with age, as women 40 and \n     older die at a rate of 81.9 per 100,000 births compared to \n     10.6 per 100,000 for women under 25. This translates to women \n     over 40 being 7.7 times more likely to die compared to their \n     counterparts under 25 years of age.\n       (8) The COVID-19 pandemic risks exacerbating the maternal \n     health crisis. A recent study of the Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention suggests that pregnant women are at a \n     significantly higher risk for severe outcomes, including \n     death, from COVID-19 as compared to non-pregnant women. The \n     COVID-19 pandemic has also decreased access to prenatal and \n     postpartum care.\n       (9) The findings described in paragraphs (1) through (8) \n     are of major concern to researchers, academics, members of \n     the business community, and providers across the obstetric \n     continuum represented by organizations such as--\n       (A) the American College of Nurse-Midwives;\n       (B) the American College of Obstetricians and \n     Gynecologists;\n       (C) the American Medical Association;\n       (D) the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and \n     Neonatal Nurses;\n       (E) the Black Mamas Matter Alliance;\n       (F) the Black Women's Health Imperative;\n       (G) the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative;\n       (H) EverThrive Illinois;\n       (I) the Illinois Perinatal Quality Collaborative;\n       (J) the March of Dimes;\n       (K) the National Association of Certified Professional \n     Midwives;\n       (L) the National Birth Equity Collaborative;\n       (M) the National Partnership for Women & Families;\n       (N) the National Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Association;\n       (O) the Preeclampsia Foundation;\n       (P) the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine; and\n       (Q) the What To Expect Project.\n       (10) Hemorrhage, cardiovascular and coronary conditions, \n     cardiomyopathy, infection or sepsis, embolism, mental health \n     conditions (including substance use disorder), hypertensive \n     disorders, stroke and cerebrovascular accidents, and \n     anesthesia complications are the predominant medical causes \n     of maternal-related deaths and complications. Most of these \n     conditions are largely preventable or manageable. Even when \n     these conditions are not preventable, mortality and morbidity \n     may be prevented when conditions are diagnosed and treated in \n     a timely manner.\n       (11) According to a study published by the Journal of \n     Perinatal Education, doula-assisted mothers are 4 times less \n     likely to have a low-birthweight baby, 2 times less likely to \n     experience a birth complication involving themselves or their \n     baby, and significantly more likely to initiate \n     breastfeeding. Doula care has also been shown to produce cost \n     savings resulting in part from reduced rates of cesarean and \n     pre-term births.\n       (12) Intimate partner violence is one of the leading causes \n     of maternal death, and women are more likely to experience \n     intimate partner violence during pregnancy than at any other \n     time in their lives. It is also more dangerous than \n     pregnancy. Intimate partner violence during pregnancy and \n     postpartum crosses every demographic and has been exacerbated \n     by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n       (13) Oral health is an important part of perinatal health. \n     Reducing bacteria in a woman's mouth during pregnancy can \n     significantly reduce her risk of developing oral diseases and \n     spreading decay-causing bacteria to her baby. Moreover, some \n     evidence suggests that women with periodontal disease during \n     pregnancy could be at greater risk for poor birth outcomes, \n     such as preeclampsia, pre-term birth, and low-birth weight. \n     Furthermore, a woman's oral health during pregnancy is a good \n     predictor of her newborn's oral health, and since mothers can \n     unintentionally spread oral bacteria to their babies, putting \n     their children at higher risk for tooth decay, prevention \n     efforts should happen even before children are born, as a \n     matter of pre-pregnancy health and prenatal care during \n     pregnancy.\n       (14) In the United States, death reporting and analysis is \n     a State function rather than a Federal process. States report \n     all deaths--including maternal deaths--on a semi-voluntary \n     basis, without standardization across States. While the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has the capacity \n     and system for collecting death-related data based on death \n     certificates, these data are not sufficiently reported by \n     States in an organized and standard format across States such \n     that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is able \n     to identify causes of maternal death and best practices for \n     the prevention of such death.\n       (15) Vital statistics systems often underestimate maternal \n     mortality and are insufficient data sources from which to \n     derive a full scope of medical and social determinant factors \n     contributing to maternal deaths, such as intimate partner \n     violence. While the addition of pregnancy checkboxes on death \n     certificates since 2003 have likely improved States' \n     abilities to identify pregnancy-related deaths, they are not \n     generally completed by obstetric providers or persons trained \n     to recognize pregnancy-related mortality. Thus, these vital \n     forms may be missing information or may capture inconsistent \n     data. Due to varying maternal mortality-related analyses, \n     lack of reliability, and granularity in data, current \n     maternal mortality informatics do not fully encapsulate the \n     myriad medical and socially determinant factors that \n     contribute to such high maternal mortality rates within the \n     United States compared to other developed nations. Lack of \n     standardization of data and data sharing across States and \n     between Federal entities, health networks, and research \n     institutions keep the Nation in the dark about ways to \n     prevent maternal deaths.\n       (16) Having reliable and valid State data aggregated at the \n     Federal level are critical to the Nation's ability to quell \n     surges in maternal death and imperative for researchers to \n     identify long-lasting interventions.\n       (17) Leaders in maternal wellness highly recommend that \n     maternal deaths and cases of maternal morbidity, including \n     complications that result in chronic illness and future \n     increased risk of death, be investigated at the State level \n     first, and that standardized, streamlined, de-identified data \n     regarding maternal deaths be sent annually to the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention. Such data standardization and \n     collection would be similar in operation and effect to the \n     National Program of Cancer Registries of the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention and akin to the Confidential \n     Enquiry in Maternal Deaths Programme in the United Kingdom. \n     Such a maternal mortalities and morbidities registry and \n     surveillance system would help providers, academicians, \n     lawmakers, and the public to address questions concerning the \n     types of, causes of, and best practices to thwart, maternal \n     mortality and morbidity.\n       (18) The United Nations' Millennium Development Goal 5a \n     aimed to reduce by 75 percent, between 1990 and 2015, the \n     maternal mortality rate, yet this metric has not been \n     achieved. In fact, the maternal mortality rate in the United \n     States has been estimated to have more than doubled between \n     2000 and 2014.\n       (19) Many States have struggled to establish or maintain \n     Maternal Mortality Review\n\n[[Page S860]]\n\n     Committees (referred to in this section as ``MMRC''). On the \n     State level, MMRCs have lagged because States have not had \n     the resources to mount local reviews. State-level reviews are \n     necessary as only the State departments of health have the \n     authority to request medical records, autopsy reports, and \n     police reports critical to the function of the MMRC.\n       (20) The United States has no comparable, coordinated \n     Federal process by which to review cases of maternal \n     mortality, systems failures, or best practices. Many States \n     have active MMRCs and leverage their work to impact maternal \n     wellness. For example, the State of California has worked \n     extensively with their State health departments, health and \n     hospital systems, and research collaborative organizations, \n     including the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative \n     and the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health, to \n     establish MMRCs, wherein such State has determined the most \n     prevalent causes of maternal mortality and recorded and \n     shared data with providers and researchers, who have \n     developed and implemented safety bundles and care protocols \n     related to preeclampsia, maternal hemorrhage, peripartum \n     cardiomyopathy, and the like. In this way, the State of \n     California has been able to leverage its maternal mortality \n     review board system, generate data, and apply those data to \n     effect changes in maternal care-related protocol. To date, \n     the State of California has reduced its maternal mortality \n     rate, which is now comparable to the low rates of the United \n     Kingdom.\n       (21) Hospitals and health systems across the United States \n     lack standardization of emergency obstetric protocols before, \n     during, and after delivery. Consequently, many providers are \n     delayed in recognizing critical signs indicating maternal \n     distress that quickly escalate into fatal or near-fatal \n     incidences. Moreover, any attempt to address an obstetric \n     emergency that does not consider both clinical and public \n     health approaches falls woefully under the mark of excellent \n     care delivery. State-based perinatal quality collaboratives, \n     or entities participating in the Alliance for Innovation on \n     Maternal Health (AIM), have formed obstetric protocols, tool \n     kits, and other resources to improve system care and response \n     as they relate to maternal complications and warning signs \n     for such conditions as maternal hemorrhage, hypertension, and \n     preeclampsia. These perinatal quality collaboratives serve an \n     important role in providing infrastructure that supports \n     quality improvement efforts addressing obstetric care and \n     outcomes. State-based perinatal quality collaboratives \n     partner with hospitals, physicians, nurses, patients, public \n     health, and other stakeholders to provide opportunities for \n     collaborative learning, rapid response data, and quality \n     improvement science support to achieve systems-level change.\n       (22) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports \n     that nearly half of all maternal deaths occur in the \n     immediate postpartum period--the 42 days following a \n     pregnancy--whereas more than one-third of maternal deaths \n     occur while a person is still pregnant. Further, 21 percent \n     of maternal deaths occur between 1 and 6 weeks postpartum, \n     and 12 percent of maternal deaths occur during the remaining \n     portion of the postpartum year. Yet, for women eligible for \n     the Medicaid program on the basis of pregnancy, such Medicaid \n     coverage lapses at the end of the month on which the 60th \n     postpartum day lands.\n       (23) The experience of serious traumatic events, such as \n     being exposed to domestic violence, substance use disorder, \n     or pervasive and systematic racism, can over-activate the \n     body's stress-response system. Known as toxic stress, the \n     repetition of high-doses of cortisol to the brain, can harm \n     healthy neurological development and other body systems, \n     which can have cascading physical and mental health \n     consequences, as documented in the Adverse Childhood \n     Experiences study of the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention.\n       (24) A growing body of evidence-based research has shown \n     the correlation between the stress associated with systematic \n     racism and one's birthing outcomes. The undue stress of sex \n     and race discrimination paired with institutional racism has \n     been demonstrated to contribute to a higher risk of maternal \n     mortality, irrespective of one's gestational age, maternal \n     age, socioeconomic status, educational level, or individual-\n     level health risk factors, including poverty, limited access \n     to prenatal care, and poor physical and mental health \n     (although these are not nominal factors). Black women remain \n     the most at risk for pregnancy-associated or pregnancy-\n     related causes of death. When it comes to preeclampsia, for \n     example, for which obesity is a risk factor, Black women of \n     normal weight remain at a higher at risk of dying during the \n     perinatal period compared to non-Black obese women.\n       (25) The rising maternal mortality rate in the United \n     States is driven predominantly by the disproportionately high \n     rates of Black maternal mortality.\n       (26) Compared to women from other racial and ethnic \n     demographics, Black women across the socioeconomic spectrum \n     experience prolonged, unrelenting stress related to \n     systematic racial and gender discrimination, contributing to \n     higher rates of maternal mortality, giving birth to low-\n     weight babies, and experiencing pre-term birth. Racism is a \n     risk-factor for these aforementioned experiences. This \n     cumulative stress, called weathering, often extends across \n     the life course and is situated in everyday spaces where \n     Black women establish livelihood. Systematic racism, \n     structural barriers, lack of access to care, lack of access \n     to nutritious food, and social determinants of health \n     exacerbate Black women's likelihood to experience poor or \n     fatal birthing outcomes, but do not fully account for the \n     great disparity.\n       (27) Black women are twice as likely to experience \n     postpartum depression, and disproportionately higher rates of \n     preeclampsia compared to White women.\n       (28) Racism is deeply ingrained in United States systems, \n     including in health care delivery systems between patients \n     and providers, often resulting in disparate treatment for \n     pain, irreverence for cultural norms with respect to health, \n     and dismissiveness. However, the provider pool is not primed \n     with many people of color, nor are providers (whether \n     maternity care clinicians or maternity care support \n     personnel) consistently required to undergo implicit bias, \n     cultural competency, respectful care practices, or empathy \n     training on a consistent, on-going basis.\n       (29) Not all people who have been pregnant or given birth \n     identify as being a ``woman''. The terms ``birthing people'' \n     or ``birthing persons'' are also used to describe pregnant \n     and postpartum people.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide Federal matching funding for State-level \nbroadband programs; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the American \nBroadband Buildout Act. This legislation would help ensure that rural \nAmericans have access to broadband services at the speeds they need to \nparticipate fully in the benefits of our modern society and economy. I \nwant to thank my colleague Senator Rosen for joining me in introducing \nthis bill today.\n  Twenty-five years ago, Americans typically accessed the internet \nusing their home phone lines via modems, capable of downloading data at \njust 56 kilobits per second, too slow even to support MP3-quality \nstreaming music. Today, the Federal Communications Commission defines \nbroadband service as having a threshold download speed nearly 500 times \nfaster.\n  Many areas of our country, particularly our rural communities, simply \ndo not have the infrastructure to achieve these speeds and fully tap \ninto the opportunities that digital connectivity can deliver. According \nto a 2019 Pew Research Center survey, nearly 37 percent of rural \nAmericans lack a broadband connection compared to 25 percent of urban \nAmericans.\n  Similar disparities occur in terms of broadband adoption. That is the \nrate at which Americans subscribe to broadband service once they have \naccess to it.\n  The survey also found that 15 percent of rural Americans don't use \nthe internet at home compared to just 9 percent of urban Americans.\n  The current pandemic has brought these connectivity challenges into \nstark focus as many families have had to move their education, their \nworkplaces, and their healthcare services online.\n  Andrea Powers, the town manager of Fort Fairfield in northern Maine, \nrecently described a number of challenges in her community: students \nwho have to sit on the town's library steps in order to finish research \nprojects and submit their papers; a business owner who was forced to \nrelocate his company to another community in order to have a chance to \nsucceed; a senior citizen who requires the care of distant doctors but \ndoes not have the capacity to travel nor access the telehealth options.\n  Andrea told me the story of one family whose jobs rely heavily on \naccess to high-speed broadband. They were told that it would cost them \n$15,000 to bring that connection to their doorstep. Andrea summed up \nthe reality facing so many rural communities that lack access in this \nway. She said: ``We will continue to see a loss of business retention \nand expansion along with job creation. We simply cannot afford to allow \nthis to happen. Online schooling, business growth and development, \ntelehealth care, and economic agriculture success are all dependent on \n. . . affordable fiber optic broadband.''\n  Telehealth services are an essential piece of the national broadband \nconversation. Often, rural communities struggle to attract and retain \nhealthcare providers that they need to ensure access to quality care. \nBroadband is vital to bridging that gap to enable innovative healthcare \ndelivery.\n  Let me give you an example. Hospice workers at Northern Light \nHomecare were able to use the internet and video technology to help \nsupport a patient living on an island off the coast of Maine--not far \nas the seagull flies, but hours away in travel time. Although the \nconnection was poor, the video enabled nurses to monitor the patient's \ncondition and symptoms and, equally important, to provide emotional \nsupport to her and to her family. As one hospice worker put it, ``our \nhospice team could be doing so much more with video and telemonitoring \ntechnologies if only Maine had better connectivity.''\n  The American Broadband Buildout Act would help close this ``digital \ndivide'' between urban and rural America by providing up to $15 billion \nin matching grants to assist States and State-\n\n[[Page S865]]\n\napproved entities in building that ``last-mile'' infrastructure to \nbring high-speed broadband directly to homes and businesses in areas \nthat lack it.\n  Projects would have to be located in unserved areas--that is, areas \nwhere broadband is unavailable at speeds that meet the FCC standards. \nFocusing on those areas will direct support where it is most needed and \nwill protect against overbuilding where infrastructure is already in \nplace.\n  The Federal funding authorized in our bill would be matched through \npublic-private partnerships between the broadband service provider and \nthe State where they provide service. This means that States and their \nprivate sector partners will have ``skin in the game'' so that the \nprojects will be well thought out and sustainable. This model will also \nincentivize existing service providers to extend their networks to \nrural areas and swiftly connect new households.\n  Third, the bill would require that projects be designed to be \n``future proof,'' meaning that the infrastructure installed must be \ncapable of delivering higher speeds as broadband accelerates in the \nfuture. We want these investments to serve rural Americans now and in \nthe future without having to rebuild every time technology advances.\n  Our bill would also prioritize projects in States that have \ntraditionally lagged behind the national average in terms of broadband \nsubscribers and those that are at risk of falling further behind as \nbroadband speeds increase.\n  Finally, the bill would provide grants for digital literacy and \npublic awareness campaigns to encourage wider broadband adoption once \naccess is available. Increasing broadband adoption will help drive down \nthe cost of the service and make it more affordable for everyone.\n  Rural Americans need access to high-speed internet just as urban \nAmericans do. In fact, one could argue they need it even more, \nespecially during these times that can require remote work, education, \nand healthcare. The bill that Senator Rosen and I are introducing today \nwould help bridge this digital divide by funding ``future proof'' \nbroadband where it is needed most and give a boost to job creation in \nrural America.\n  As the Presiding Officer well knows, businesses will not locate in \nareas that do not have this essential service, in many cases. I urge \nall of our colleagues to join in supporting this bill.\n  Thank you\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION\n\n      By Mr. THUNE (for himself, Ms. Stabenow, Mrs. Fischer, and Mr. \n        Warner):\n\tS. 402.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Mothers and Offspring \n     Mortality and Morbidity Awareness Act'' or the ``MOMMA's \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Every year, across the United States, nearly 4,000,000 \n     women give birth, about 700 women suffer fatal complications \n     during pregnancy, while giving birth or during the postpartum \n     period, and about 70,000 women suffer near-fatal, partum-\n     related complications.\n       (2) The maternal mortality rate is often used as a proxy to \n     measure the overall health of a population. While the infant \n     mortality rate in the United States has reached its lowest \n     point, the risk of death for women in the United States \n     during pregnancy, childbirth, or the postpartum period is \n     higher than such risk in many other high-income countries. \n     The estimated maternal mortality rate (deaths per 100,000 \n     live births) for the 48 contiguous States and Washington, \n     D.C. increased from 14.5 percent in 2000 to 17.3 in 2017. The \n     United States is the only industrialized nation with a rising \n     maternal mortality rate.\n       (3) The National Vital Statistics System of the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention has found that in 2018, there \n     were 17.4 maternal deaths for every 100,000 live births in \n     the United States. This ratio is more than double that of \n     most other high-income countries.\n       (4) It is estimated that more than 60 percent of maternal \n     deaths in the United States are preventable.\n       (5) According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, the maternal mortality rate varies drastically \n     for women by race and ethnicity. There are about 13 deaths \n     per 100,000 live births for White women, 40.8 deaths per \n     100,000 live births for non-Hispanic Black women, and 29.7 \n     deaths per 100,000 live births for American Indian/Alaskan \n     Native women. While maternal mortality disparately impacts \n     Black women, this urgent public health crisis traverses race, \n     ethnicity, socioeconomic status, educational background, and \n     geography.\n       (6) In the United States, non-Hispanic Black women are \n     about 3 times more likely to die from causes related to \n     pregnancy and childbirth compared to non-Hispanic White \n     women, which is one of the most disconcerting racial \n     disparities in public health. This disparity widens in \n     certain cities and States across the country.\n       (7) According to the National Center for Health Statistics \n     of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the \n     maternal mortality rate heightens with age, as women 40 and \n     older die at a rate of 81.9 per 100,000 births compared to \n     10.6 per 100,000 for women under 25. This translates to women \n     over 40 being 7.7 times more likely to die compared to their \n     counterparts under 25 years of age.\n       (8) The COVID-19 pandemic risks exacerbating the maternal \n     health crisis. A recent study of the Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention suggests that pregnant women are at a \n     significantly higher risk for severe outcomes, including \n     death, from COVID-19 as compared to non-pregnant women. The \n     COVID-19 pandemic has also decreased access to prenatal and \n     postpartum care.\n       (9) The findings described in paragraphs (1) through (8) \n     are of major concern to researchers, academics, members of \n     the business community, and providers across the obstetric \n     continuum represented by organizations such as--\n       (A) the American College of Nurse-Midwives;\n       (B) the American College of Obstetricians and \n     Gynecologists;\n       (C) the American Medical Association;\n       (D) the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and \n     Neonatal Nurses;\n       (E) the Black Mamas Matter Alliance;\n       (F) the Black Women's Health Imperative;\n       (G) the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative;\n       (H) EverThrive Illinois;\n       (I) the Illinois Perinatal Quality Collaborative;\n       (J) the March of Dimes;\n       (K) the National Association of Certified Professional \n     Midwives;\n       (L) the National Birth Equity Collaborative;\n       (M) the National Partnership for Women & Families;\n       (N) the National Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Association;\n       (O) the Preeclampsia Foundation;\n       (P) the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine; and\n       (Q) the What To Expect Project.\n       (10) Hemorrhage, cardiovascular and coronary conditions, \n     cardiomyopathy, infection or sepsis, embolism, mental health \n     conditions (including substance use disorder), hypertensive \n     disorders, stroke and cerebrovascular accidents, and \n     anesthesia complications are the predominant medical causes \n     of maternal-related deaths and complications. Most of these \n     conditions are largely preventable or manageable. Even when \n     these conditions are not preventable, mortality and morbidity \n     may be prevented when conditions are diagnosed and treated in \n     a timely manner.\n       (11) According to a study published by the Journal of \n     Perinatal Education, doula-assisted mothers are 4 times less \n     likely to have a low-birthweight baby, 2 times less likely to \n     experience a birth complication involving themselves or their \n     baby, and significantly more likely to initiate \n     breastfeeding. Doula care has also been shown to produce cost \n     savings resulting in part from reduced rates of cesarean and \n     pre-term births.\n       (12) Intimate partner violence is one of the leading causes \n     of maternal death, and women are more likely to experience \n     intimate partner violence during pregnancy than at any other \n     time in their lives. It is also more dangerous than \n     pregnancy. Intimate partner violence during pregnancy and \n     postpartum crosses every demographic and has been exacerbated \n     by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n       (13) Oral health is an important part of perinatal health. \n     Reducing bacteria in a woman's mouth during pregnancy can \n     significantly reduce her risk of developing oral diseases and \n     spreading decay-causing bacteria to her baby. Moreover, some \n     evidence suggests that women with periodontal disease during \n     pregnancy could be at greater risk for poor birth outcomes, \n     such as preeclampsia, pre-term birth, and low-birth weight. \n     Furthermore, a woman's oral health during pregnancy is a good \n     predictor of her newborn's oral health, and since mothers can \n     unintentionally spread oral bacteria to their babies, putting \n     their children at higher risk for tooth decay, prevention \n     efforts should happen even before children are born, as a \n     matter of pre-pregnancy health and prenatal care during \n     pregnancy.\n       (14) In the United States, death reporting and analysis is \n     a State function rather than a Federal process. States report \n     all deaths--including maternal deaths--on a semi-voluntary \n     basis, without standardization across States. While the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has the capacity \n     and system for collecting death-related data based on death \n     certificates, these data are not sufficiently reported by \n     States in an organized and standard format across States such \n     that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is able \n     to identify causes of maternal death and best practices for \n     the prevention of such death.\n       (15) Vital statistics systems often underestimate maternal \n     mortality and are insufficient data sources from which to \n     derive a full scope of medical and social determinant factors \n     contributing to maternal deaths, such as intimate partner \n     violence. While the addition of pregnancy checkboxes on death \n     certificates since 2003 have likely improved States' \n     abilities to identify pregnancy-related deaths, they are not \n     generally completed by obstetric providers or persons trained \n     to recognize pregnancy-related mortality. Thus, these vital \n     forms may be missing information or may capture inconsistent \n     data. Due to varying maternal mortality-related analyses, \n     lack of reliability, and granularity in data, current \n     maternal mortality informatics do not fully encapsulate the \n     myriad medical and socially determinant factors that \n     contribute to such high maternal mortality rates within the \n     United States compared to other developed nations. Lack of \n     standardization of data and data sharing across States and \n     between Federal entities, health networks, and research \n     institutions keep the Nation in the dark about ways to \n     prevent maternal deaths.\n       (16) Having reliable and valid State data aggregated at the \n     Federal level are critical to the Nation's ability to quell \n     surges in maternal death and imperative for researchers to \n     identify long-lasting interventions.\n       (17) Leaders in maternal wellness highly recommend that \n     maternal deaths and cases of maternal morbidity, including \n     complications that result in chronic illness and future \n     increased risk of death, be investigated at the State level \n     first, and that standardized, streamlined, de-identified data \n     regarding maternal deaths be sent annually to the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention. Such data standardization and \n     collection would be similar in operation and effect to the \n     National Program of Cancer Registries of the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention and akin to the Confidential \n     Enquiry in Maternal Deaths Programme in the United Kingdom. \n     Such a maternal mortalities and morbidities registry and \n     surveillance system would help providers, academicians, \n     lawmakers, and the public to address questions concerning the \n     types of, causes of, and best practices to thwart, maternal \n     mortality and morbidity.\n       (18) The United Nations' Millennium Development Goal 5a \n     aimed to reduce by 75 percent, between 1990 and 2015, the \n     maternal mortality rate, yet this metric has not been \n     achieved. In fact, the maternal mortality rate in the United \n     States has been estimated to have more than doubled between \n     2000 and 2014.\n       (19) Many States have struggled to establish or maintain \n     Maternal Mortality Review \n     Committees (referred to in this section as ``MMRC''). On the \n     State level, MMRCs have lagged because States have not had \n     the resources to mount local reviews. State-level reviews are \n     necessary as only the State departments of health have the \n     authority to request medical records, autopsy reports, and \n     police reports critical to the function of the MMRC.\n       (20) The United States has no comparable, coordinated \n     Federal process by which to review cases of maternal \n     mortality, systems failures, or best practices. Many States \n     have active MMRCs and leverage their work to impact maternal \n     wellness. For example, the State of California has worked \n     extensively with their State health departments, health and \n     hospital systems, and research collaborative organizations, \n     including the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative \n     and the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health, to \n     establish MMRCs, wherein such State has determined the most \n     prevalent causes of maternal mortality and recorded and \n     shared data with providers and researchers, who have \n     developed and implemented safety bundles and care protocols \n     related to preeclampsia, maternal hemorrhage, peripartum \n     cardiomyopathy, and the like. In this way, the State of \n     California has been able to leverage its maternal mortality \n     review board system, generate data, and apply those data to \n     effect changes in maternal care-related protocol. To date, \n     the State of California has reduced its maternal mortality \n     rate, which is now comparable to the low rates of the United \n     Kingdom.\n       (21) Hospitals and health systems across the United States \n     lack standardization of emergency obstetric protocols before, \n     during, and after delivery. Consequently, many providers are \n     delayed in recognizing critical signs indicating maternal \n     distress that quickly escalate into fatal or near-fatal \n     incidences. Moreover, any attempt to address an obstetric \n     emergency that does not consider both clinical and public \n     health approaches falls woefully under the mark of excellent \n     care delivery. State-based perinatal quality collaboratives, \n     or entities participating in the Alliance for Innovation on \n     Maternal Health (AIM), have formed obstetric protocols, tool \n     kits, and other resources to improve system care and response \n     as they relate to maternal complications and warning signs \n     for such conditions as maternal hemorrhage, hypertension, and \n     preeclampsia. These perinatal quality collaboratives serve an \n     important role in providing infrastructure that supports \n     quality improvement efforts addressing obstetric care and \n     outcomes. State-based perinatal quality collaboratives \n     partner with hospitals, physicians, nurses, patients, public \n     health, and other stakeholders to provide opportunities for \n     collaborative learning, rapid response data, and quality \n     improvement science support to achieve systems-level change.\n       (22) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports \n     that nearly half of all maternal deaths occur in the \n     immediate postpartum period--the 42 days following a \n     pregnancy--whereas more than one-third of maternal deaths \n     occur while a person is still pregnant. Further, 21 percent \n     of maternal deaths occur between 1 and 6 weeks postpartum, \n     and 12 percent of maternal deaths occur during the remaining \n     portion of the postpartum year. Yet, for women eligible for \n     the Medicaid program on the basis of pregnancy, such Medicaid \n     coverage lapses at the end of the month on which the 60th \n     postpartum day lands.\n       (23) The experience of serious traumatic events, such as \n     being exposed to domestic violence, substance use disorder, \n     or pervasive and systematic racism, can over-activate the \n     body's stress-response system. Known as toxic stress, the \n     repetition of high-doses of cortisol to the brain, can harm \n     healthy neurological development and other body systems, \n     which can have cascading physical and mental health \n     consequences, as documented in the Adverse Childhood \n     Experiences study of the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention.\n       (24) A growing body of evidence-based research has shown \n     the correlation between the stress associated with systematic \n     racism and one's birthing outcomes. The undue stress of sex \n     and race discrimination paired with institutional racism has \n     been demonstrated to contribute to a higher risk of maternal \n     mortality, irrespective of one's gestational age, maternal \n     age, socioeconomic status, educational level, or individual-\n     level health risk factors, including poverty, limited access \n     to prenatal care, and poor physical and mental health \n     (although these are not nominal factors). Black women remain \n     the most at risk for pregnancy-associated or pregnancy-\n     related causes of death. When it comes to preeclampsia, for \n     example, for which obesity is a risk factor, Black women of \n     normal weight remain at a higher at risk of dying during the \n     perinatal period compared to non-Black obese women.\n       (25) The rising maternal mortality rate in the United \n     States is driven predominantly by the disproportionately high \n     rates of Black maternal mortality.\n       (26) Compared to women from other racial and ethnic \n     demographics, Black women across the socioeconomic spectrum \n     experience prolonged, unrelenting stress related to \n     systematic racial and gender discrimination, contributing to \n     higher rates of maternal mortality, giving birth to low-\n     weight babies, and experiencing pre-term birth. Racism is a \n     risk-factor for these aforementioned experiences. This \n     cumulative stress, called weathering, often extends across \n     the life course and is situated in everyday spaces where \n     Black women establish livelihood. Systematic racism, \n     structural barriers, lack of access to care, lack of access \n     to nutritious food, and social determinants of health \n     exacerbate Black women's likelihood to experience poor or \n     fatal birthing outcomes, but do not fully account for the \n     great disparity.\n       (27) Black women are twice as likely to experience \n     postpartum depression, and disproportionately higher rates of \n     preeclampsia compared to White women.\n       (28) Racism is deeply ingrained in United States systems, \n     including in health care delivery systems between patients \n     and providers, often resulting in disparate treatment for \n     pain, irreverence for cultural norms with respect to health, \n     and dismissiveness. However, the provider pool is not primed \n     with many people of color, nor are providers (whether \n     maternity care clinicians or maternity care support \n     personnel) consistently required to undergo implicit bias, \n     cultural competency, respectful care practices, or empathy \n     training on a consistent, on-going basis.\n       (29) Not all people who have been pregnant or given birth \n     identify as being a ``woman''. The terms ``birthing people'' \n     or ``birthing persons'' are also used to describe pregnant \n     and postpartum people.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide Federal matching funding for State-level broadband programs; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\tMs. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the American Broadband Buildout Act. This legislation would help ensure that rural Americans have access to broadband services at the speeds they need to participate fully in the benefits of our modern society and economy. I want to thank my colleague Senator Rosen for joining me in introducing this bill today.\n\tTwenty-five years ago, Americans typically accessed the internet using their home phone lines via modems, capable of downloading data at just 56 kilobits per second, too slow even to support MP3-quality streaming music. Today, the Federal Communications Commission defines broadband service as having a threshold download speed nearly 500 times faster.\n\tMany areas of our country, particularly our rural communities, simply do not have the infrastructure to achieve these speeds and fully tap into the opportunities that digital connectivity can deliver. According to a 2019 Pew Research Center survey, nearly 37 percent of rural Americans lack a broadband connection compared to 25 percent of urban Americans.\n\tSimilar disparities occur in terms of broadband adoption. That is the rate at which Americans subscribe to broadband service once they have access to it.\n\tThe survey also found that 15 percent of rural Americans don't use the internet at home compared to just 9 percent of urban Americans.\n\tThe current pandemic has brought these connectivity challenges into stark focus as many families have had to move their education, their workplaces, and their healthcare services online.\n\tAndrea Powers, the town manager of Fort Fairfield in northern Maine, recently described a number of challenges in her community: students who have to sit on the town's library steps in order to finish research projects and submit their papers; a business owner who was forced to relocate his company to another community in order to have a chance to succeed; a senior citizen who requires the care of distant doctors but does not have the capacity to travel nor access the telehealth options.\n\tAndrea told me the story of one family whose jobs rely heavily on access to high-speed broadband. They were told that it would cost them $15,000 to bring that connection to their doorstep. Andrea summed up the reality facing so many rural communities that lack access in this way. She said: ``We will continue to see a loss of business retention and expansion along with job creation. We simply cannot afford to allow this to happen. Online schooling, business growth and development, telehealth care, and economic agriculture success are all dependent on . . . affordable fiber optic broadband.''\n\tTelehealth services are an essential piece of the national broadband conversation. Often, rural communities struggle to attract and retain healthcare providers that they need to ensure access to quality care. Broadband is vital to bridging that gap to enable innovative healthcare delivery.\n\tLet me give you an example. Hospice workers at Northern Light Homecare were able to use the internet and video technology to help support a patient living on an island off the coast of Maine--not far as the seagull flies, but hours away in travel time. Although the connection was poor, the video enabled nurses to monitor the patient's condition and symptoms and, equally important, to provide emotional support to her and to her family. As one hospice worker put it, ``our hospice team could be doing so much more with video and telemonitoring technologies if only Maine had better connectivity.''\n\tThe American Broadband Buildout Act would help close this ``digital divide'' between urban and rural America by providing up to $15 billion in matching grants to assist States and State- approved entities in building that ``last-mile'' infrastructure to bring high-speed broadband directly to homes and businesses in areas that lack it.\n\tProjects would have to be located in unserved areas--that is, areas where broadband is unavailable at speeds that meet the FCC standards. Focusing on those areas will direct support where it is most needed and will protect against overbuilding where infrastructure is already in place.\n\tThe Federal funding authorized in our bill would be matched through public-private partnerships between the broadband service provider and the State where they provide service. This means that States and their private sector partners will have ``skin in the game'' so that the projects will be well thought out and sustainable. This model will also incentivize existing service providers to extend their networks to rural areas and swiftly connect new households.\n\tThird, the bill would require that projects be designed to be ``future proof,'' meaning that the infrastructure installed must be capable of delivering higher speeds as broadband accelerates in the future. We want these investments to serve rural Americans now and in the future without having to rebuild every time technology advances.\n\tOur bill would also prioritize projects in States that have traditionally lagged behind the national average in terms of broadband subscribers and those that are at risk of falling further behind as broadband speeds increase.\n\tFinally, the bill would provide grants for digital literacy and public awareness campaigns to encourage wider broadband adoption once access is available. Increasing broadband adoption will help drive down the cost of the service and make it more affordable for everyone.\n\tRural Americans need access to high-speed internet just as urban Americans do. In fact, one could argue they need it even more, especially during these times that can require remote work, education, and healthcare. The bill that Senator Rosen and I are introducing today would help bridge this digital divide by funding ``future proof'' broadband where it is needed most and give a boost to job creation in rural America.\n\tAs the Presiding Officer well knows, businesses will not locate in areas that do not have this essential service, in many cases. I urge all of our colleagues to join in supporting this bill.\n\tThank you\n\n                          ____________________", "speakers": ["John Thune", "Richard J.

Res. 72\n\n       Whereas the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (commonly \n     referred to as the ``JCPOA''), an agreement that was \n     finalized by the administration of President Barack Obama and \n     the governments of the United Kingdom, Germany, France, the \n     People's Republic of China, and the Russian Federation in \n     July 2015, provided Iran permanent sanctions relief and \n     access to more than $100,000,000,000 in return for temporary \n     restrictive measures on Iran's nuclear program;\n       Whereas, under the JCPOA, restrictions on the number and \n     types of centrifuges that Iran may manufacture, retain, test, \n     and use, the number and types of enrichment facilities that \n     Iran may construct, and the amount and level of enriched \n     uranium and heavy water that Iran may stockpile, will expire;\n       Whereas multiple United Nations Security Council \n     resolutions adopted between 2006 and 2010 required Iran to \n     suspend all enrichment of uranium, but the JCPOA did not \n     require Iran to cease its enrichment of uranium, a failure \n     that is directly responsible for Iran's expanded enrichment \n     activity today;\n       Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231 (in \n     this preamble referred to as ``UNSCR 2231''), adopted on July \n     20, 2015, called on Iran not to undertake any activity \n     related to nuclear-capable ballistic missile activities for 8 \n     years and imposed a 5-year ban on conventional arms transfers \n     to and from Iran;\n       Whereas neither the JCPOA nor UNSCR 2231 adequately \n     addressed the threat emanating from Iran's ballistic and \n     cruise missile program or long-standing support for \n     terrorism, and the sunset provisions applied to prohibitions \n     in UNSCR 2231 and the JCPOA severely weakened their \n     restrictions and inadvertently legitimized that program and \n     support;\n       Whereas, based on the shortcomings of the JCPOA and UNSCR \n     2231, bipartisan majorities in both the Senate and the House \n     of Representatives opposed the JCPOA and the sanctions relief \n     for Iran contained in the agreement;\n       Whereas the sanctions relief contained in the JCPOA \n     provided resources necessary for Iran to continue developing \n     ballistic missiles and supporting terrorism;\n       Whereas the United States Government has designated Iran's \n     Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (in this preamble referred \n     to as the ``IRGC'') as a foreign terrorist organization under \n     section 219(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1189(a)) and a specially designated global terrorist \n     entity pursuant to Executive Order 13224 (50 U.S.C. 1701 \n     note;

which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs:\n\n                               S. Res. 72\n\n       Whereas the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (commonly \n     referred to as the ``JCPOA''), an agreement that was \n     finalized by the administration of President Barack Obama and \n     the governments of the United Kingdom, Germany, France, the \n     People's Republic of China, and the Russian Federation in \n     July 2015, provided Iran permanent sanctions relief and \n     access to more than $100,000,000,000 in return for temporary \n     restrictive measures on Iran's nuclear program;\n       Whereas, under the JCPOA, restrictions on the number and \n     types of centrifuges that Iran may manufacture, retain, test, \n     and use, the number and types of enrichment facilities that \n     Iran may construct, and the amount and level of enriched \n     uranium and heavy water that Iran may stockpile, will expire;\n       Whereas multiple United Nations Security Council \n     resolutions adopted between 2006 and 2010 required Iran to \n     suspend all enrichment of uranium, but the JCPOA did not \n     require Iran to cease its enrichment of uranium, a failure \n     that is directly responsible for Iran's expanded enrichment \n     activity today;\n       Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231 (in \n     this preamble referred to as ``UNSCR 2231''), adopted on July \n     20, 2015, called on Iran not to undertake any activity \n     related to nuclear-capable ballistic missile activities for 8 \n     years and imposed a 5-year ban on conventional arms transfers \n     to and from Iran;\n       Whereas neither the JCPOA nor UNSCR 2231 adequately \n     addressed the threat emanating from Iran's ballistic and \n     cruise missile program or long-standing support for \n     terrorism, and the sunset provisions applied to prohibitions \n     in UNSCR 2231 and the JCPOA severely weakened their \n     restrictions and inadvertently legitimized that program and \n     support;\n       Whereas, based on the shortcomings of the JCPOA and UNSCR \n     2231, bipartisan majorities in both the Senate and the House \n     of Representatives opposed the JCPOA and the sanctions relief \n     for Iran contained in the agreement;\n       Whereas the sanctions relief contained in the JCPOA \n     provided resources necessary for Iran to continue developing \n     ballistic missiles and supporting terrorism;\n       Whereas the United States Government has designated Iran's \n     Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (in this preamble referred \n     to as the ``IRGC'') as a foreign terrorist organization under \n     section 219(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1189(a)) and a specially designated global terrorist \n     entity pursuant to Executive Order 13224 (50 U.S.C. 1701 \n     note;

Res. 75\n\n       Whereas, in 1776, people envisioned the United States as a \n     new nation dedicated to the proposition stated in the \n     Declaration of Independence that ``all men are created equal, \n     that they are endowed by their Creator with certain \n     unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and \n     the pursuit of Happiness'';\n       Whereas Africans were first brought involuntarily to the \n     shores of the United States as early as the 17th century;\n       Whereas African Americans suffered enslavement and \n     subsequently faced the injustices of lynch mobs, segregation, \n     and denial of the basic and fundamental rights of \n     citizenship;\n       Whereas, in 2021, the vestiges of those injustices and \n     inequalities remain evident in the society of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas, in the face of injustices, people of good will and \n     of all races in the United States have distinguished \n     themselves with a commitment to the noble ideals on which the \n     United States was founded and have fought courageously for \n     the rights and freedom of African Americans and others;\n       Whereas African Americans, such as Lieutenant Colonel Allen \n     Allensworth, Maya Angelou, Arthur Ashe, Jr., James Baldwin, \n     James Beckwourth, Clara Brown, Blanche Bruce, Ralph Bunche, \n     Shirley Chisholm, Holt Collier, Miles Davis, Louis Armstrong, \n     Larry Doby, Frederick Douglass, W.

Woodson set \n     aside a special period in February to recognize the heritage \n     and achievements of Black people in the United States;\n       Whereas Dr. Carter G.

Res. 75\n\n       Whereas, in 1776, people envisioned the United States as a \n     new nation dedicated to the proposition stated in the \n     Declaration of Independence that ``all men are created equal, \n     that they are endowed by their Creator with certain \n     unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and \n     the pursuit of Happiness'';\n       Whereas Africans were first brought involuntarily to the \n     shores of the United States as early as the 17th century;\n       Whereas African Americans suffered enslavement and \n     subsequently faced the injustices of lynch mobs, segregation, \n     and denial of the basic and fundamental rights of \n     citizenship;\n       Whereas, in 2021, the vestiges of those injustices and \n     inequalities remain evident in the society of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas, in the face of injustices, people of good will and \n     of all races in the United States have distinguished \n     themselves with a commitment to the noble ideals on which the \n     United States was founded and have fought courageously for \n     the rights and freedom of African Americans and others;\n       Whereas African Americans, such as Lieutenant Colonel Allen \n     Allensworth, Maya Angelou, Arthur Ashe, Jr., James Baldwin, \n     James Beckwourth, Clara Brown, Blanche Bruce, Ralph Bunche, \n     Shirley Chisholm, Holt Collier, Miles Davis, Louis Armstrong, \n     Larry Doby, Frederick Douglass, W.

For millions of those senior adults, they asked the \nsame question almost a year ago: When can I get out of my home? When \ncan I see people? And the answer consistently was: Once there is a \nvaccine. When we get a vaccine in place, this will be better. We don't \nknow how long that will take, but once we get a vaccine, we will be \nable to turn this around.\n  Seniors heard that over and over and over and over again for the last \n11\\1/2\\ months. And, now, thankfully, millions of seniors have been \nvaccinated. We have 42 million Americans that have gone through the \nfull regimen. In my State, almost 20 percent of the adults in my State \nhave already had their vaccine. We are one of the top States in the \ncountry, by percentage, getting vaccines out to individuals. Almost \nevery person in every assisted-living nursing home, critical care \nfacility, staff, and residents have been vaccinated. Almost every \nsingle senior adult in my State has been fully vaccinated, and we are \ninto the second round now of teachers and those with comorbidities and \nother folks that has already begun.\n  But interestingly enough, seniors are still asking the same question. \nI had my shot. I had my second shot. It has now been the 10 days past \nmy second shot, but nothing is changed.\n  A couple of weeks ago, I asked CDC a very simple question. It is the \nquestion that I am getting asked that I continue to ask CDC. When will \ninstructions come out on what seniors need to do now? Can they get out? \nCan they hug their grandkids? Can they go to Walmart? Can guests come \nto assisted-living facilities?\n  They were all together during Christmas and Halloween and now \nValentine's Day, and they are used to having kids come in and sing \nsongs and people come to visit them.

We are thinking about it. We are researching it.\n  CDC needs to act on this. Seniors have been cooped up for a year. \nThey were told months ago, ``Once you get a vaccine, this will get \nbetter,'' and they are now finding they had their vaccine and nothing \nis getting better.

Help our seniors out by getting \nclear guidelines out into the public. Give instructions to assisted-\nliving facilities; give instructions to these grandparents. What do \nthey need to do now that they have been vaccinated? How much travel can \nthey have? What are the risks? And let them make the decisions on it.\n  Folks are counting on them to be able to lay some of the science out \nthere, and it is time to get the information out to those folks so they \ncan make the right decision.

What do they need to do now that they have been vaccinated? How much travel can they have? What are the risks? And let them make the decisions on it.\n\tFolks are counting on them to be able to lay some of the science out there, and it is time to get the information out to those folks so they can make the right decision. CDC, we need you to step up.\n\tWith that, I yield the floor.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am here on the floor today to talk \nabout the need for all of us to redouble our efforts to combat drug \naddiction. One of the top priorities I have had in my time in public \nservice has been to combat this crisis, which has devastated so many \nfamilies, destroyed so many communities, and impacted us in so many \nnegative ways.\n  Unfortunately, under the cover of the coronavirus pandemic, there is \nan epidemic that is growing, and that is the drug addiction epidemic. \nIt is heartbreaking because we actually had several years of progress. \nWe were making progress, finally, in turning the tide, and now, it is \ncoming back with a vengeance to the point that overdoses and overdose \ndeaths, hospitalizations, and all the other negative consequences of \ndrug addiction is being raised up again in the context of the \ncoronavirus.\n  Here, in the Congress, we have taken a leadership role on addressing \nthis issue. Over the last several years, Congress has appropriated \nbillions of dollars--and not that money solves everything, but the \nmoney has been pretty well spent on programs that are actually tested, \nevidence-based programs on prevention, on treatment, and longer term \nrecovery.\n  Once called the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, which I \nauthored with my colleague, Sheldon Whitehouse, on the other side of \nthe aisle, there is other legislation, too, called the 21st Century \nCures Act. All of this has provided help that goes down to the local \nlevel, the community level, to be able to create a network, to be able \nto push back against the addiction crisis.\n  In 2017, Ohio's overdose opioid death rate was almost three times the \nnational average. Ohio was one of the worst States in the country in \nterms of our opioid addiction. In terms of opioid deaths, we were top \nthree in the country. It is not something you want to be at the top of. \nNearly a dozen Ohioans were dying from these dangerous drugs every \nsingle day. This is in 2017. It surpassed car crashes as our country's \nNo. 1 killer among young people and, for Ohio, the No. 1 overall.\n  But that next year, in 2018, much of what we were doing here in \nCongress, the work again on the CARA Act, the Cures Act, and other \nthings that were being done at the State level and local level that \nwere being supported by our Federal legislation, they were starting to \nwork. So, in 2018, Ohio led the country again, but this time it wasn't \nin overdose deaths. It was in the reduction of overdose deaths. We \nactually had a 22-percent reduction from 2017 to 2018.\n  By the way, the same thing happened nationally. We had a reduction in \noverdose deaths nationally in 2018 for the first time since 1990. Think \nabout that. From 1990 until 2018, every single year, we had more people \ndying from overdoses in this country, driven in large part by opioids, \nand, more recently, by the most deadly of opioids, synthetic opioids \nlike fentanyl and Carfentanil.\n  Unfortunately, again, under the cover of this coronavirus pandemic, \ndrug addiction has flourished, and that positive progress has been \nreversed. It is heartbreaking. While we need to remain committed to \nsolving the healthcare challenges of COVID-19, there is increasing \nevidence that the stresses of this unprecedented time are driving a \nspike in drug abuse and subsequent overdoses, this making 2020 the \nworst year in the history of our country in terms of overdose deaths \nand other measurements of drug addiction.\n\n  Why? Well, I have asked a lot of people that. Common sense would tell \nyou people are lonelier. Many people are distraught. Maybe they have \nlost their job. Maybe they have had someone in their family die of \nCOVID-19. People are feeling anxious. People are unable to access \nrecovery programs in person, so they can't go sit down with their \nrecovery coach, which they might have been able to do but for COVID-19 \nand the isolation that is required. Many of those in recovery from \naddiction are stalled in their progress, or they are suffering from \nrelapses.\n  There is a story that ran last week about a record number of overdose \ndeaths in my home State of Ohio. It was on FOX 8 in Cleveland. One of \nthe people they interviewed was a Cleveland woman who had lost her son \nto an overdose. It was pretty powerful. She talked about how important \nit is for people fighting addiction to have that network of support. It \nwas hard to find during COVID-19. She said: ``An addict needs to talk \nto someone, they need constant reassuring from their support group.''\n  She is right. There are a lot of troubling statistics out there that \nshould be a cause for concern and a call to action for all of us. The \nCenters for Disease Control reported that more than 81,000 people died \nof drug overdoses in the 12 months ending in May 20 of 2020, the \nhighest 12-month total in our Nation's history. So, again, it looks \nlike 2020 is going to be the worst year ever.\n  The American Medical Association reports that more than 40 States \nhave reported an increase in opioid-related deaths during the COVID-19 \npandemic. A recent study in the JAMA Psychiatry journal found that a \n45-percent increase was the overdose death increase in emergency rooms \nfrom April to October of 2020 compared to that same time in 2019.\n  It would be worse, in my view, without the Federal response to the \ncoronavirus pandemic, including some measures to ensure those suffering \nfrom addiction can continue to get the care they need through \ntelehealth. We have cut redtape. We have provided some regulatory \nrelief to expand telehealth and telehealth options specifically for \nopioid treatment, like eliminating requirements for in-person visits \nbefore prescribing lifesaving drugs like buprenorphine.\n  Without these expanded services, I believe the overdose spike would \nbe even worse. Although there is no substitute for face-to-face \ninteraction to help along an individual's journey to recovery, \ntelehealth has kept patients in touch with their doctors at least and \nallowed physicians to prescribe medication-assisted treatment remotely.\n  In talking to those who are recovery coaches or those doctors back \nhome who specialize in addiction, they tell me they believe that the \ntelehealth option has been extremely important, so even though it has \ngotten worse, it would have gotten even worse if people had not had at \nleast the ability to access their recovery program through a remote \nmeans.\n  Interestingly, these telehealth options for addiction treatments were \nput in place temporarily, but they have proven to be such a viable \noption for addiction treatment that now people are talking about making \nthem permanent. I agree with that. I don't think it makes sense to get \naway from them as this pandemic goes away, which is why yesterday, \nalong with my colleague, Sheldon Whitehouse, I entered this legislation \ncalled the Telehealth Response for E-Prescribing Addiction Services \nTreatment Act. The reason that is such a long name is we wanted to make \nthe acronym TREATS, which it is. The TREATS Act makes permanent a \nnumber of temporary waivers for telehealth services and bolsters \ntelehealth options for addiction treatment services.\n  Let's turn to a couple of things specifically. First, it allows for a \npatient to be prescribed lower-scheduled drugs like Suboxone through a \ntelehealth visit on their first visit, as opposed to having to go in \nperson for that first visit.\n  Current law requires an in-person visit when you need an initial \nprescription for controlled substances, but this has been a real \ndeterrent for patients in crisis and in urgent need of treatments from \nSchedule III or Schedule\n\n[[Page S871]]\n\nIV drugs like Suboxone or certain drugs for reoccurring mental health \nconditions, so our bill is important in that regard.\n  It also limits abusive practices by limiting telehealth visits to \nthose who have both audio and video capabilities to be able to interact \nwith the treatment providers to reduce fraud and abuse when it is your \nfirst visit. It would also keep the existing requirements for in-person \nvisits when prescribing Schedule II drugs like opioids or stimulants \nthat are more prone to being abused during these telehealth visits. So \nwe have provisions in there to avoid abuse, but it is important to \ncontinue this telehealth option when other options just aren't there.\n  Second, our bill would allow for Medicare to bill for audio-only or \ntelephone telehealth services for mental health and substance abuse \ntreatment if it is not the patient's first visit. Due to distance or \naccess to broadband, in-person visits or even video appointments aren't \nalways possible for our seniors. We still need to focus on safety and \nrobust treatment options, but in order to balance the needs of \npatients, we propose to allow our Nation's seniors under Medicare to \nuse phones for subsequent mental health or behavioral health visits \nwhen they don't have access to the internet and where face-to-face \ninteraction just isn't as necessary.\n  I believe this TREATS legislation will make a difference in the \naddiction treatment space and will help us prevent more untimely \noverdoses, but it is also important that we ensure that law enforcement \nofficials can continue to go after the supply of lethal drugs coming \ninto our communities, lethal drugs that are fueling these overdoses.\n  The most important thing, in my view, is reducing the demand dealing \nwith prevention, treatment, and recovery, but by stopping some of the \nflow of these drugs, among other things, you are reducing the supply, \nwhich raises the cost of these drugs on the street. And, unfortunately, \nsome of these drugs are unbelievably inexpensive, given how incredibly \npowerful and deadly they can be.\n  Data from the Center for Disease Control shows that the biggest \ndriver of these surge in overdose deaths has been the class of drugs \ncalled synthetic opioids. We talked about that a moment ago. They are \nfar deadlier than the traditional opioids like heroin but still cause \nfar too many overdoses.\n  The most well known of these drugs, fentanyl, is about 50 times \ndeadlier than heroin, and it is often less expensive. It is illegally \nmanufactured primarily in China, and then it is smuggled across our \nsouthern border or through the U.S. mail. A pound of fentanyl is lethal \nenough to kill half a million people. Think about that. One pound is \nenough to kill half a million people.\n  We have made some progress keeping it out of the mail system. The \nSTOP Act is now in effect. We are working with the Postal Service and \nalso working with Customs and Border Protection to properly implement \nthat legislation, which I authored on a bipartisan basis here several \nyears ago, and it is finally being implemented to keep our mail system \nfrom delivering poison into our communities.\n  But the traffickers have changed patterns, and a lot of it is now \ngoing to Mexico and then coming over land across our southern border.\n  Across the country, law enforcement have had their hands full trying \nto stop the flow of synthetic opioids. Ohio State Patrol troopers \nseized a total of 129 pounds of fentanyl last year, enough to kill more \nthan 60 million people. We have 11.8 million people in Ohio, but our \ntroopers, just in Ohio, seized enough fentanyl to kill 60 million \npeople.\n  In one Ohio county, Cuyahoga County, there were more than 1,700 \nseizures of fentanyl by law enforcement in 2020. One DEA initiative to \nfight drug trafficking that started just last August of 2020 has \nresulted in the seizure of nearly 440 pounds of fentanyl.\n  Fentanyl itself is a schedule II drug, which means that law \nenforcement is able to take appropriate actions to crack down on it, \nand that is good. But there is a hidden challenge with fentanyl, and \nthat is that manufacturers can alter its chemical makeup in a lab to \nmake what is known as a fentanyl analog or a copycat. It is all \nsynthetic. So if some evil chemist somewhere can adjust the formula and \nmake it an analog, it is not subject to the schedule II charges that \nlaw enforcement can bring. Because the chemical makeup is different in \nfentanyl, it is not automatically illegal at all, in fact. What is \nworse, these copycats can often be deadlier than fentanyl--take, for \ninstance, carfentanil, which is 100 times as deadly as fentanyl and \nabout 10,000 times more deadly than morphine. Just handling \ncarfentanil, if you were to spill some on yourself, can kill you.\n  In 2018, the Drug Enforcement Agency, DEA, made the right call by \ntemporarily making these fentanyl-related substances illegal to \npossess, transport, or manufacture. Thanks to that designation, our law \nenforcement officials have been better able to protect our communities \nby seizing and destroying these fentanyl-related substances.\n  Unfortunately, the temporary extension by DEA ends in only a few \nmonths. After May 6, 2021, these incredibly dangerous substances will \nno longer be subject to strict regulation by law enforcement. It will \nbe easier for drug manufacturers in China and elsewhere to flood the \nUnited States with carfentanil and other synthetic opioids. We can't \nallow that to happen.\n  Of course, we can't allow that to happen, which is why yesterday I \nintroduced the bipartisan Federal Initiative to Guarantee Health by \nTargeting Fentanyl, or FIGHT Fentanyl Act, along with my colleague \nSenator Joe Manchin from West Virginia, another State that has been \ndevastated by the opioid epidemic. Our bill simply codifies the \nexisting DEA precedent to permanently schedule fentanyl-related \nsubstances, allowing our law enforcement officials to continue to crack \ndown on synthetic opioid in all of its forms. Let's provide some \ncertainty, some predictability here, and make this permanent.\n  Just as importantly, it is going to send a signal to both the \nAmerican people and the manufacturers and smugglers that produce \nsynthetic opioids that we have not forgotten about this threat, and we \nare going to do everything in our power to keep these deadly drugs out \nof our communities.\n  The FIGHT Fentanyl Act and the TREATS Act are a couple of things that \nwe could do right now on a bipartisan basis, and we should. I urge my \ncolleagues to support them.\n  But we have a lot more work to do in the months ahead. The \nauthorization for the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act, the CARA \nbill we talked about earlier, expires in fiscal year 2023. And Senator \nWhitehouse and I will soon introduce a CARA 2.0 Act to build on the \nsuccesses of CARA with an unprecedented investment in expanding access \nto proven treatment and recovery programs--again, programs that are \nshown to work by evidence for treatment and recovery than longer term \nrecovery.\n  CARA 2.0 includes dozens of provisions to address addiction from all \nfronts--research and education, treatment and recovery, criminal \njustice reform, dealing with prescription drugs--making it the most \ncomprehensive legislation in our country's history. When added with the \nexisting CARA programs that are reauthorized through 2023, we would be \ninvesting well over $1 billion to address this longstanding epidemic, \nagain, at a time when under the pandemic the epidemic is growing.\n  We need to be sure that as we continue to invest in the coronavirus \nvaccine development and distribution, we are also focusing on this \nepidemic. As we come out of this coronavirus pandemic--and I believe we \nare starting to see some signs of that--let's be sure we are not \nleaving in its wake more and more deaths and more and more addiction \nwith regard to the drug addiction crisis.\n  We need to all recognize the urgency of working to reverse this surge \nand nationwide overdoses and overdose deaths. As we emerge from this \ncoronavirus pandemic, let's act now to ensure we have the tools in \nplace to also turn the tide on this disease and get those affected the \nhelp they need.\n  I yield my time.\n\n[[Page S872]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "OPIOID EPIDEMIC\n\n\tMr. PORTMAN.
